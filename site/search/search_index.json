FCS Board President Chris Aldrich's emphatic claim of an \"unbiased investigation\" now stands in stark contrast to the facts, representing either a profound failure of oversight or a deliberate attempt to mislead the community. Our exhaustive review of over 2,600 documents provides incontrovertible evidence that not only contradicts this assertion but raises serious questions about the integrity of the entire investigative process.</p> <p>The initial disclosures we received, ostensibly professional in nature, have proven to be merely the tip of an iceberg of obfuscation. It was only through our  application of legal precedent that we compelled the release of more candid communications. These revelations paint a stark picture of an administration engaged in a coordinated effort to shape the Findlay First Edition investigation to serve interests other than those of truth and transparency.</p> <p>The disparity between the administration's public statements and their private actions is not merely disappointing \u2013 it is a matter of grave concern. It casts a long shadow over the integrity of the entire investigative process and subsequent administrative decisions. This goes beyond simple misjudgment; it represents a fundamental breach of the public trust placed in these educational leaders.</p> <p>For months, Findlay City Schools engaged in a calculated campaign of delays, legal maneuvers, and outright obstruction to prevent the release of information pertaining to their investigation into Kevin Manley and the Findlay First Edition show choir. </p> <p>Our legal approach further exposed the administration's hypocrisy, setting a precedent that would render their own FFE investigation report insufficient by the same standards they attempted to use against us.</p> <p>Their actions begged the question: What were they so desperate to hide?</p> <p>It is imperative to note that our public records request should have, by law, encompassed all materials pertinent to the FFE investigation, save for those protected by specific legal exemptions. Findlay City Schools' response, by their own assertion, was intended to fulfill all legally disclosable information. Thus, we are led to conclude that the materials presented herein represent the complete body of existing documentation related to this investigation.</p> <p>The materials released by Findlay City Schools in July, in response to my request, reveal at best a level of incompetence that should alarm every parent, teacher, and taxpayer in the district. At its most benign interpretation, it demonstrates a level of administrative incompetence that is deeply troubling. At its worst, it suggests a calculated effort to mislead the entire community.</p> <p>This leaves us with a critical question that demands immediate address: To what extent was the Board of Education aware of or involved in these actions? The implications of either their complicity or their ignorance are profound and necessitate swift, decisive action to restore the integrity of our school district's governance.</p> <p>As you review this report, I urge you to approach it with the gravity it deserves. The depth and breadth of the issues uncovered here demand not just our attention but our action. This document lays bare the facts that Findlay City Schools fought so vigorously to keep from public view. It reveals a pattern of misinformation, questionable decision-making, and what appears to be a systemic abuse of power that undermines the very foundations of trust upon which our educational system must be built.</p> <p>The time has come for accountability and reform. Findlay deserves no less.</p> <p>Signed, </p> <p>John R. Eakin</p> <p>Read the Report</p>"},{"location":"sections/Approach%20to%20FCS%20Lawsuit.html","title":"Lawsuit Strategy","text":""},{"location":"sections/Approach%20to%20FCS%20Lawsuit.html#explanation-of-approach-to-lawsuit-against-findlay-city-schools","title":"Explanation of Approach to Lawsuit Against Findlay City Schools","text":""},{"location":"sections/Approach%20to%20FCS%20Lawsuit.html#background-and-motivation","title":"Background and Motivation","text":"<p>After receiving an unsatisfactory response (1) from Findlay City Schools (FCS) to our letter (2), despite glaring factual inaccuracies, and facing what appeared to be obstruction in obtaining requested information through a public information request, Eakin filed a lawsuit in May 2024.

These types of statements are often referred to as \"boilerplate\" denials or qualifications commonly used by public entities when replying to information requests. The intended purpose is to cover a wide range of potential legal and procedural issues.</p> Read Boilerplate Denials <p>Please be advised, your request is denied because it is overly broad and ambiguous. In providing a response to a request, the District is not required \u201cto do research or to identify records containing selected information\u201d or produce an entire category of records. See State ex rel. Fant v. Tober, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 63737, 1993 WL 173743, *1 (Apr. 28, 1993), aff'd, 68 Ohio St.3d 117 (1993). Instead, a requester must identify the records he or she is seeking \u201cwith reasonable clarity.\u201d State ex rel. Glasgow v. Jones, 119 Ohio St.3d 391, 2008-Ohio-4788, \u00b617. Requests for general categories of content or which seek all records \u201cregarding or related to\u201d a specified topic are overbroad. Morgan v. Strickland, 121 Ohio St.3d 600, 2009-Ohio-1901, at \u00b6 14\u201315. Likewise, requests seeking all correspondence between certain senders/recipients over expansive periods of time and/or involving vague subject matters or keywords do not permit the District sufficient clarity to identify responsive records. See Patton v. Univ. of Akron, Ct. of Cl. No. 2017-00820PQ, 2018-Ohio-1555, \u00b6 10; Hicks v. Newtown, Ct. of Cl. No. 2017-Ohio-00612-PQ, 2017-Ohio-8952, \u00b6 8. As such, your request lacks specificity and particularity, and invariably requests documents or categories of documents that do not exist or do not align with the District\u2019s record retention schedule (attached)  </p> <p>Your request is further denied in part to the extent it seeks documents and records that are protected from release in accordance with state and/or federal law. For example, records covered by the attorney-client are protected from release. This includes legal advice of any kind and communications between the District and its legal counsel. State ex rel. Leslie v. Ohio Hous. Fin. Agency, 105 Ohio St.3d 261, 2005-Ohio-1508. Similarly, any records containing either the education records or the non-directory, personally identifiable information of students are not subject to release. 20 USC 1232g (FERPA); R.C. 3319.321. Any record that \u201cdirectly relates\u201d to a student is considered the educational record of that student and is therefore confidential. 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 99.3. Id. This protection also pertains to information that, alone or in combination, is linked or linkable to a specific student that would allow a reasonable person in the school community, who does not have personal knowledge of the relevant circumstances, to identify the student with reasonable certainty. Federal law further protects from release any information requested by a person who the District reasonably believes knows the identity of the student to whom the education record relates. This further includes the personal notes of District employees and officials, which are not considered public records for the purposes of R.C. 149.43. See Hunter v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp., 10th Dist. No. 13AP-457, 2014-Ohio-5660, 16-17, 23-35.  </p> <p>Finally, your request is denied in part to the extent you seek records that do not constitute public records, are protected from release, and/or do not exist. A public office is not obligated to create records in response to a request for unrecorded or not-currently-recorded information, rather than a request for specific existing records containing such information. State ex rel. White v. Goldsberry, 85 Ohio St.3d 153, 154, 1999-Ohio-447 (a public office has \u201cno duty under R.C. 149.43 to create new records.\u201d). Additionally, the District has no obligation to identify those documents not produced or that do not exist, as this would amount to the creation of a privilege log, which the District has \u201cno duty under R.C. 149.43 to submit.\u201d State ex rel. Lanham v. DeWine, 135 Ohio St.3d 191, 2013-Ohio-199.  </p>"},{"location":"sections/Key%20Information%20from%20the%20PIR.html#suspicious-timing-crisis-intervention-team-information-shared-prior-to-reported-issues","title":"Suspicious Timing: Crisis Intervention Team Information Shared Prior to Reported Issues","text":"<p>On October 19, a significant exchange occurred between key figures in the Findlay City Schools administration:</p> <ul> <li>Sender: Assistant Superintendent</li> <li>Recipient: Superintendent Hatton (Superintendent)</li> <li>Content: 'Crisis Intervention Team' pamphlet</li> </ul>"},{"location":"sections/Key%20Information%20from%20the%20PIR.html#key-observations","title":"Key Observations:","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Relevance to FFE:</p> <ul> <li>This correspondence was included in the Public Information Request (PIR) response.</li> <li>The PIR specifically requested information related to Findlay First Edition (FFE).</li> <li>Its inclusion suggests a direct connection to the FFE situation.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Timing Discrepancy:</p> <ul> <li>This exchange took place one month before any issues were officially reported.</li> <li>The timing raises questions about the administration's foreknowledge or preparation for potential FFE-related events.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Visual Evidence:</p> <ul> <li>Two images are provided as proof of this correspondence:<ol> <li>The initial information exchange</li> <li>The first page of the Crisis Intervention brochure </li> </ol> </li> </ul> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"sections/Key%20Information%20from%20the%20PIR.html#shifting-dynamics-manley-hatton-relationship-and-confirmation-of-proper-reporting","title":"Shifting Dynamics: Manley-Hatton Relationship and Confirmation of Proper Reporting","text":""},{"location":"sections/Key%20Information%20from%20the%20PIR.html#cordial-relationship-prior-to-investigation","title":"Cordial Relationship Prior to Investigation","text":"<ul> <li> <p>November 1: Kevin Manley thanked Superintendent Hatton for being the Master of Ceremonies at the FFE Fall Fest.</p> <ul> <li>Notably, Manley referred to the Superintendent as \"Andy,\" indicating a friendly, informal relationship.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Post-November 10: Even after the initial meeting about FFE concerns, Manley continued to address Hatton as \"Andy.\"</p> <ul> <li>This suggests the relationship remained cordial despite emerging issues.  </li> </ul> <p></p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"sections/Key%20Information%20from%20the%20PIR.html#confirmation-of-proper-reporting-by-manley","title":"Confirmation of Proper Reporting by Manley","text":"<ul> <li>November 8: A crucial email from FCS Principal Meg Simon revealed:<ul> <li>Simon expressed a desire to discuss with Manley \"the contents of the FFE parent communication you received.\"</li> <li>This email serves as evidence that Manley properly reported issues within the show choir to the administration.</li> <li>Importantly, this correspondence was omitted from the FFE Investigation report.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"sections/Key%20Information%20from%20the%20PIR.html#significance-of-the-omission","title":"Significance of the Omission","text":"<p>The exclusion of this email from the investigation report raises serious questions about the thoroughness and impartiality of the investigation.

You go back and review the transcript and pick up on things that you might have missed or might have left out. But when you don't have that recording, when you don't have that transcript, you're really left only with what's on top of mind.</p> <p>Recent evidence has come to light that further substantiates these concerns. An email from the investigator, Janice Collette, dated November 26, reveals several troubling aspects of her approach to the investigation:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Organizational Issues: Collette admitted to potentially losing track of critical documents, stating she couldn't recall if \"Andy\" had sent them previously. This is particularly concerning given that email inboxes have search functions, suggesting a lack of basic organizational skills crucial for a thorough investigation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Questionable Professional Affiliation: Collette used an @aol.com email address, not one associated with the Educational Service Center of Central Ohio (ESCCO), the agency FCS claims they hired. This raises questions about her official capacity and the legitimacy of her engagement.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Overextension and Lack of Focus: Collette mentioned being \"involved with several investigations\" and losing track of materials. This admission reinforces concerns about her ability to give full attention to each case, potentially compromising the quality and accuracy of her findings. </p> </li> <li> <p>Inadequate Preparation: The email indicates that as of November 26, Collette did not have access to district manuals, which are hundreds of pages long. Yet, she began conducting interviews the very next day, raising serious doubts about her preparedness and understanding of the district's policies and procedures.</p> </li> <li> <p>Inherent Bias in Information Gathering: Given Superintendent Hatton's instructions to FCS administrators to suppress positive testimony, there's a concern that Collette may have been \"teaching to the test\" - only documenting negative information that aligned with a predetermined narrative.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Summary</p> <p>These revelations significantly undermine the credibility of the investigation. They suggest not only a lack of professional rigor in the investigative process but also raise questions about the objectivity and completeness of the findings. The absence of recorded interviews, combined with these organizational and preparatory shortcomings, casts serious doubt on the reliability of the investigation's conclusions and the fairness of any actions taken based on its findings.  </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"sections/Key%20Information%20from%20the%20PIR.html#fcs-administrations-problematic-handling-of-the-ffe-investigation","title":"FCS Administration's Problematic Handling of the FFE Investigation","text":"<p>This analysis highlights three key issues in the Findlay City Schools (FCS) administration's management of the FFE investigation: lack of communication, inconsistent decision-making, and questionable integrity in the process.</p>"},{"location":"sections/Key%20Information%20from%20the%20PIR.html#1-failure-to-communicate-with-ffe-parents","title":"1.
