FCS Board President Chris Aldrich's emphatic claim of an \"unbiased investigation\" now stands in stark contrast to the facts, representing either a profound failure of oversight or a deliberate attempt to mislead the community. Our exhaustive review of over 2,600 documents provides incontrovertible evidence that not only contradicts this assertion but raises serious questions about the integrity of the entire investigative process.</p> <p>The initial disclosures we received, ostensibly professional in nature, have proven to be merely the tip of an iceberg of obfuscation. It was only through our  application of legal precedent that we compelled the release of more candid communications. These revelations paint a stark picture of an administration engaged in a coordinated effort to shape the Findlay First Edition investigation to serve interests other than those of truth and transparency.</p> <p>The disparity between the administration's public statements and their private actions is not merely disappointing \u2013 it is a matter of grave concern. It casts a long shadow over the integrity of the entire investigative process and subsequent administrative decisions. This goes beyond simple misjudgment; it represents a fundamental breach of the public trust placed in these educational leaders.</p> <p>For months, Findlay City Schools engaged in a calculated campaign of delays, legal maneuvers, and outright obstruction to prevent the release of information pertaining to their investigation into Kevin Manley and the Findlay First Edition show choir. </p> <p>Our legal approach further exposed the administration's hypocrisy, setting a precedent that would render their own FFE investigation report insufficient by the same standards they attempted to use against us.</p> <p>Their actions begged the question: What were they so desperate to hide?</p> <p>It is imperative to note that our public records request should have, by law, encompassed all materials pertinent to the FFE investigation, save for those protected by specific legal exemptions. Findlay City Schools' response, by their own assertion, was intended to fulfill all legally disclosable information. Thus, we are led to conclude that the materials presented herein represent the complete body of existing documentation related to this investigation.</p> <p>The materials released by Findlay City Schools in July, in response to my request, reveal at best a level of incompetence that should alarm every parent, teacher, and taxpayer in the district. At its most benign interpretation, it demonstrates a level of administrative incompetence that is deeply troubling. At its worst, it suggests a calculated effort to mislead the entire community.</p> <p>This leaves us with a critical question that demands immediate address: To what extent was the Board of Education aware of or involved in these actions? The implications of either their complicity or their ignorance are profound and necessitate swift, decisive action to restore the integrity of our school district's governance.</p> <p>As you review this report, I urge you to approach it with the gravity it deserves. The depth and breadth of the issues uncovered here demand not just our attention but our action. This document lays bare the facts that Findlay City Schools fought so vigorously to keep from public view. It reveals a pattern of misinformation, questionable decision-making, and what appears to be a systemic abuse of power that undermines the very foundations of trust upon which our educational system must be built.</p> <p>The time has come for accountability and reform. Findlay deserves no less.</p> <p>Signed, </p> <p>John R.

Any identifying marks, stamps, or notations from the original document have been intentionally omitted from this publication to maintain confidentiality.  </p> <p>It's worth noting that this rebuttal letter, despite Mr. Manley's explicit request that it be \"attached to all copies of the January 15, 2024, Investigator's report,\" has never been released to the public. Findlay City Schools did not issue an updated version of the Investigation Report that included Mr. Manley's response, effectively keeping his rebuttal private until now.  </p> <p>The full content of the letter, additional documentation and summary follows:  </p> <p>May 9, 2024</p> <p>To:  Dr. Andy Hatton, Findlay City Schools Superintendent From:  Kevin Manley  Re: Response to written reprimand and directive  </p> <p></p> DELIVERED BY HAND DELIVERY <p>Dr. Hatton,  </p> <p>This letter will serve as my rebuttal to the written reprimand and directive dated January 19, 2024.  In this letter, I will be addressing the reprimand, along with the investigation findings from Ms. Janice Collette dated January 15, 2024. Please note that this rebuttal focuses on the matters addressed in your January 19 letter, and the aspects of Ms. Collette\u2019s investigation and report that pertain to those matters.   </p> <p>To be very clear, there is a great deal more that I disagree with in regard to the investigation and report than what is stated in this letter. The fact that I do not specifically cite and respond to a matter addressed in either your January 19 letter or Ms. Collette\u2019s report should not be taken as my agreement. I am focused on providing my students with the very best I have to give for the remainder of this school year, and it is counterproductive to that goal to dwell upon every point of disagreement or upon my deep disappointment in so many aspects of this situation.        </p> <p>I.    Regarding the January 19, 2024, Reprimand: </p> <ul> <li> <p>The initial report: In your letter, you state that the District received numerous reports surrounding the negative culture of FFE.  It is important to note that the first concern was brought to me by an FFE parent on November 1, 2023.  Despite the parent\u2019s reluctance, I immediately reported these concerns to Mr. Laux-- within minutes, in fact. Neither your letter of reprimand nor the investigative findings acknowledge that I reported these concerns to the Administration.  Rather, your letter and the report make it seem as if parents and/or community members reported concerns to the District without my knowledge.  </p> <p>After reporting the concerns to Mr. Laux, he informed me that he would have to take the concerns to Mrs. Simon.  I met with Mrs. Simon later that day and shared the concerns with her.  At the conclusion of the meeting, Mrs. Simon said \u201c\u2026thank you for telling me about this.  Go home, don\u2019t worry about it, and have a good weekend.\u201d  We did not meet again to follow up with the concerns until November 9. </p> </li> <li> <p>Off-campus parties: I was only aware of two parties.  These included the FFE Guys/FFE Girls parties (held on or around May 30, 2023), and the party at Canterbury Swim Club on July 15, 2023. As the reprimand states, I was not aware of a Christmas party and was on administrative leave at that time, so I do not understand why student conduct from that party was described in the reprimand. </p> <p>The FFE Girls/Guys parties are held at a private residence during the summer months, and last summer were held at a Findlay City Schools staff member\u2019s home, which reassured me that the Student Code of Conduct would be followed.  The investigative findings did not state any concerns from the FFE Girls party, so we are left to conclude that the Code of Conduct was followed.  </p> <p>The only substantiated concern raised from the Guys party is the handing out of white t shirts.  These t shirts were a welcoming gift to the new members, and I had given strict instructions to the FFE seniors to not use nicknames on the shirts.  The FFE senior girls give the new members a rose, so the FFE guys wanted to also give a welcoming gift.  </p> <p>The July 15 party was attended by all FFE members and parents to celebrate a successful Summer Camp and Garage Sale. I attended this party.   </p> <p>I strongly feel that teachers, advisors, and coaches cannot be held responsible for the actions of students when they are at a private residence off-campus and outside of school hours.  Asking teachers to be responsible for students when they are not in our purview sets an unattainable standard and an unfair precedent for all teachers and coaches. </p> </li> <li> <p>Student Code of Conduct:   I am confident that FFE is not the only student activity at Findlay High School that has suffered violations of the Code of Conduct. I have immediately reported any such violations that came to my attention during my 19 years as FFE Director.   </p> <p>I will add that on several occasions I requested that a student\u2019s disciplinary penalty  be more severe, only to be denied by the Administration.  The Administration also undermined disciplinary consequences that I had given by rolling back the consequences and allowing students to perform or continue in the group.  </p> <p>FFE is a group that provides a welcoming and positive culture in our rehearsals and performances. This is evident in the long-standing tradition of success our group has experienced.  This level of success could not be achieved in an environment where all students do not feel welcomed. Our success has been noted not only within our District, but also throughout the community and the Mid-West.  Whenever we travel, it is common for people to tell us that we are the most well behaved, professional, and classy group they have ever seen. </p> </li> <li> <p>Verbal directive: As you are aware, you provided me with a verbal directive on November 9, asking me not to discuss the investigation with any staff, parents, or students.  Upon returning to my office after our meeting, I met with FHS Assistant Choir Director Krista Bigger.  I told her that there was going to be an investigation into FFE, and I cannot talk about it with her.  Later that afternoon, Krista returned from the FHS main office.  She told me that she had just spoken with Mrs. Simon and that Mrs. Simon told her that she (Krista) could talk to me because we are colleagues.  </p> <p>At this point, I assumed that I was also free to talk with my other colleague, the FFE assistant director, whom I contacted on November 11 to discuss how I was feeling-- not to discuss details about the investigation.  I knew that she was upset about the concerns that had been brought forward from our November 8 conversation (prior to receiving your directive).  The point of my conversation with my FFE assistant was simply to express my mental state, and to also check in on her.  At no time did we discuss details of the investigation, or the names of students involved. </p> </li> <li> <p>Discipline: Based upon the information I was provided concerning the outcome of the investigation, I believe that my discipline was disproportionate to that of a similarly situated staff member whose student had received discipline as a result of the investigation. </p> <p>Also, to the extent the discipline relies upon Ms. Collette\u2019s investigation, her report was not conducted pursuant to any particular Board policy. When my OEA attorney asked the Board\u2019s attorney to specify the Board policies governing the investigation, he replied as follows in a January 11, 2024, email: </p> \u201cSince a public complaint was not filed against Mr. Manley, Janice [Collette] is not utilizing any particular policy.\u00a0 I believe she is reviewing all District policies as part of her investigation.\u201d <p>As a result, I did not have the benefit of the Title IX policy rights to respond to and rebut the evidence before a report was issued. Nor did not have the full benefit of the collective bargaining agreement\u2019s complaint procedure. To reiterate, I reported the parent\u2019s concern. Yet, as I will address below, I became the target of the \u201cno particular policy\u201d investigation after being repeatedly told I was not a target. </p> </li> </ul> <p>II.   Regarding the investigative report and findings of Ms. Collette, I would like to state several observations. </p> <ul> <li> <p>Target of investigation: Throughout the investigation, it was stated verbally several times that I was not a subject of the investigation.  Instead, it was the student behavior that was being investigated.  When the final report was released, I was shocked to see it stated right at the outset that it was about my oversight of the program.  If that was the case, then I would like to know why I was not told this, and why I was in fact told the opposite. I would also like to know the instructions the Board gave Ms. Collette that led her to consider me the target of the investigation.  Either she incorrectly framed the investigation and report, or I was purposely misled by the Administration. </p> </li> <li> <p>Off-campus parties: I stated at my interview that I was aware of two parties off-campus.  Ms. Collette expressed in her interview with me that she may have the names of the parties confused, however she did not state or correct that in her report. \u201cWelcome to FFE\u201d and \u201cFFE Guys Night\u201d refer to the same party.  She was confused by this and admitted her confusion. Also, as noted above, the report mentions a  party during December of 2023, which I was not aware of because I was on administrative leave at this time.  I have never been a part of planning any off-campus FFE parties.  I believe it is also important to note that FFE is not the only student activity to have parties off-campus.  I am not aware of any Board policy that requires activity advisors or coaches to report these parties to the administration, nor do they investigate to make sure the Code of Conduct has been followed. I know of no advisor or coach who does this. </p> </li> <li> <p>\u201cFavoritism\u201d: The report\u2019s reference to \u201cblatant favoritism\u201d is inaccurate and unfair.   I did not select anyone to choose practice shirt colors for our choreography rehearsals.  The senior FFE members always volunteer to do this, and it has never been a problem in the past.  When I discovered it was a problem in early November 2023, I immediately told the students to use the Remind app for all FFE communication, and that I will send the message out to all of the students. When I made this change, I expressed my concern to Mr. Laux and told him that even though I was asking the students to use Remind, there is no way I can truly control their electronic communication with each other.  </p> <p>I was placed on leave on November 12, 2023, just a few days after changing the way communication would work in FFE.  I obviously had no knowledge of how the students were communicating with each other while I was on leave, whether on Remind or outside of the app.  I had no knowledge that the FFE students were using Snap Chat for their communications.  However, it is my understanding that this method of communicating messages is used by many student groups at Findlay High School.  I am not aware of any Board policy directing all coaches and advisors to ban Snap Chat, Group Me, and other forms of electronic communication with the groups they supervise. </p> </li> <li> <p>Student cell phone misuse: During the 2022-2023 school year, cell phone use in FHS classrooms was not only permitted, it was also enabled by the Administration\u2019s actions and inactions.  Students regularly had their cell phones out during class. When asked by teachers to put their cell phones away they seldom complied, and teachers lacked the Administration\u2019s disciplinary support in such instances.  It is very unfortunate, but the reported \u201cporn day\u201d and taking pictures of student buttocks in class is not entirely surprising with Findlay High School\u2019s permissive culture regarding cell phone use.  </p> <p>It is shocking behavior by students, yet I am sure that Choir class was not the only place these students were watching inappropriate videos or taking pictures of students.  This behavior took place during the school day, and not at an FFE rehearsal.  To say this is result of \u201csexual overtones\u201d within FFE is another extreme and baseless assumption by the Investigator.   My opinion as an educator is that cell phones should not be permitted at any time during the school day.  The report also makes it appear that I had prior knowledge of the \u201cporn day\u201d and the taking of inappropriate pictures.  If I had been aware of this, I would have immediately reported this behavior to the Administration. </p> </li> <li> <p>Scope of investigation/report: When the investigation first began, the FFE parents and the community of Findlay were told that there would be a \u201ccomplete and thorough investigation of the culture of FFE.\u201d  The Investigator represents that the investigation was thorough, yet it does not appear that she interviewed the Assistant Choir Director, FFE accompanist, FFE choreographer, and FFE costumer.  If anyone knows the culture of FFE, it would be those individuals. </p> <p>Ms. Collette states that she interviewed 27 individuals throughout the investigation.  Did these individuals have anything positive to say about myself or FFE?  If so, the report does not reflect this. The relative absence of positive observations in her report is contrary to my experience with FFE, which has included a great deal of favorable feedback regarding the program, the students, and my work. </p> </li> <li> <p>Student discipline: No FFE students were disciplined for hazing or bullying other FFE members. After the investigation concluded, I worked closely with Mrs. Simon to assign disciplinary consequences to four students.  Two were disciplined for inappropriate social media posts, and one for a negative attitude and allegedly bullying another student. The fourth student was punished for unbecoming behavior at an off-campus party that involved many other FHS students (and to my knowledge was the only student disciplined as a result of this party).  While the Administration had grounds to issue this student discipline, the four students\u2019 actions were not directly related to the \u201cactions of students in the FFE program\u201d which I\u2019d initially been told was the purpose of the investigation.  </p> <p>To another point in the report, there have in fact been instances of students \u201cbeing silly\u201d in FFE and in class. I know when student conduct warrants corrective discipline, and do not hesitate to intervene in those situations.  </p> </li> </ul> <p>Thank you for this opportunity to respond. I respectfully ask that a copy of this rebuttal be attached to all copies of the January 15, 2024, Investigator\u2019s report.  </p> <p>Sincerely, </p> <p>Kevin Manley</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/10/23/read-kevin-manleys-rebuttal.html#observations-from-kevin-manleys-rebuttal","title":"Observations from Kevin Manley's Rebuttal","text":"<ul> <li>Despite the investigation's purported focus on \"toxic culture\" within FFE, not a single student faced disciplinary action for hazing, bullying, or contributing to any alleged cultural problems.

Further investigation may be necessary to fully understand the situation.</p> <p>A former FFE member, returning to their alma mater for Homecoming, found themselves at the center of an unexpected and unpleasant encounter with FHS principal, Megan Simon. The alumnus, eager to participate in the festivities, was allegedly pressured to change their red FFE shirt due to a perceived violation of the school's \"blue and gold\" theme. This follows the pattern previously discussed around employees, students, and parents who have shown support for FFE in the presence of or communication with FCS administrators. </p> <p>This incident has further exposed the deep-seated animosity between Findlay City Schools administration and the FFE community. It demonstrates a persistent pattern of marginalizing and discriminating against FFE members, transforming what should be a celebratory homecoming event into yet another example of administrative overreach and potential harassment.  </p> <p>The confrontation over a simple red shirt reveals a troubling underlying dynamic: school administrators appear more concerned with enforcing arbitrary dress codes than fostering a welcoming environment for alumni and students. By targeting an FFE alumnus during a homecoming event\u2014a time traditionally meant for reunion and school pride\u2014the administration has once again shown its willingness to weaponize minor rules to suppress what appears to be a continuing institutional bias against FFE. This pattern of behavior raises serious questions about the professionalism and motivations of school leadership, suggesting a systemic approach to marginalizing those associated with FFE rather than promoting inclusivity and school spirit.  </p> <p>Historically, the Findlay First Edition (FFE) has been a cornerstone of Findlay High School's cultural and artistic identity, with its members consistently demonstrating excellence that enhanced the school's reputation. Through performances, competitions, and community engagement, FFE has not just represented the school, but elevated its standing, serving as a premier example of the talent and dedication inherent in Findlay's student body.  </p> <p>Today, however, this once-celebrated program finds itself increasingly at odds with an administration that seems intent on exterminating its legacy. The growing divide is not merely a disagreement, but a systematic erosion of a program that has long been a source of pride, achievement, and community recognition. What was once a jewel in Findlay High School's crown now appears to be treated as a threat\u2014a troubling transformation that speaks volumes about the current administrations's approach to institutional culture and student achievement.</p>"},{"location":"sections/Approach%20to%20FCS%20Lawsuit.html","title":"Lawsuit Strategy","text":""},{"location":"sections/Approach%20to%20FCS%20Lawsuit.html#explanation-of-approach-to-lawsuit-against-findlay-city-schools","title":"Explanation of Approach to Lawsuit Against Findlay City Schools","text":""},{"location":"sections/Approach%20to%20FCS%20Lawsuit.html#background-and-motivation","title":"Background and Motivation","text":"<p>After receiving an unsatisfactory response (1) from Findlay City Schools (FCS) to our letter (2), despite glaring factual inaccuracies, and facing what appeared to be obstruction in obtaining requested information through a public information request, Eakin filed a lawsuit in May 2024.

These types of statements are often referred to as \"boilerplate\" denials or qualifications commonly used by public entities when replying to information requests. The intended purpose is to cover a wide range of potential legal and procedural issues.</p> Read Boilerplate Denials <p>Please be advised, your request is denied because it is overly broad and ambiguous. In providing a response to a request, the District is not required \u201cto do research or to identify records containing selected information\u201d or produce an entire category of records. See State ex rel. Fant v. Tober, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 63737, 1993 WL 173743, *1 (Apr. 28, 1993), aff'd, 68 Ohio St.3d 117 (1993). Instead, a requester must identify the records he or she is seeking \u201cwith reasonable clarity.\u201d State ex rel. Glasgow v. Jones, 119 Ohio St.3d 391, 2008-Ohio-4788, \u00b617. Requests for general categories of content or which seek all records \u201cregarding or related to\u201d a specified topic are overbroad. Morgan v. Strickland, 121 Ohio St.3d 600, 2009-Ohio-1901, at \u00b6 14\u201315. Likewise, requests seeking all correspondence between certain senders/recipients over expansive periods of time and/or involving vague subject matters or keywords do not permit the District sufficient clarity to identify responsive records. See Patton v. Univ. of Akron, Ct. of Cl. No. 2017-00820PQ, 2018-Ohio-1555, \u00b6 10; Hicks v. Newtown, Ct. of Cl. No. 2017-Ohio-00612-PQ, 2017-Ohio-8952, \u00b6 8. As such, your request lacks specificity and particularity, and invariably requests documents or categories of documents that do not exist or do not align with the District\u2019s record retention schedule (attached)  </p> <p>Your request is further denied in part to the extent it seeks documents and records that are protected from release in accordance with state and/or federal law. For example, records covered by the attorney-client are protected from release. This includes legal advice of any kind and communications between the District and its legal counsel. State ex rel. Leslie v. Ohio Hous. Fin. Agency, 105 Ohio St.3d 261, 2005-Ohio-1508. Similarly, any records containing either the education records or the non-directory, personally identifiable information of students are not subject to release. 20 USC 1232g (FERPA); R.C. 3319.321. Any record that \u201cdirectly relates\u201d to a student is considered the educational record of that student and is therefore confidential. 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 99.3. Id. This protection also pertains to information that, alone or in combination, is linked or linkable to a specific student that would allow a reasonable person in the school community, who does not have personal knowledge of the relevant circumstances, to identify the student with reasonable certainty. Federal law further protects from release any information requested by a person who the District reasonably believes knows the identity of the student to whom the education record relates. This further includes the personal notes of District employees and officials, which are not considered public records for the purposes of R.C. 149.43. See Hunter v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp., 10th Dist. No. 13AP-457, 2014-Ohio-5660, 16-17, 23-35.  </p> <p>Finally, your request is denied in part to the extent you seek records that do not constitute public records, are protected from release, and/or do not exist. A public office is not obligated to create records in response to a request for unrecorded or not-currently-recorded information, rather than a request for specific existing records containing such information. State ex rel. White v. Goldsberry, 85 Ohio St.3d 153, 154, 1999-Ohio-447 (a public office has \u201cno duty under R.C. 149.43 to create new records.\u201d). Additionally, the District has no obligation to identify those documents not produced or that do not exist, as this would amount to the creation of a privilege log, which the District has \u201cno duty under R.C. 149.43 to submit.\u201d State ex rel.

This oversight raised questions about the thoroughness and reliability of the investigation process.</p> <p></p> <p>Of the 27 nterviews that that investigator did not a single one was recorded. Not one. Does that sound like an incompetent investigator to you? The police, when they investigate things, record those conversations. Courts, when they ask a series of questions, there's depositions. Fact finding. Those are recorded. Every kind of investigation that has any credibility records the interviews of witnesses. It's mostly because usually well, it's twofold. One, you have a an actual record of the interaction and the inquiry. But more importantly is, you're busy asking questions. You're busy having a conversation. You don't have time to write everything down. So you record it. You go back and review the transcript and pick up on things that you might have missed or might have left out. But when you don't have that recording, when you don't have that transcript, you're really left only with what's on top of mind.</p> <p>Recent evidence has come to light that further substantiates these concerns. An email from the investigator, Janice Collette, dated November 26, reveals several troubling aspects of her approach to the investigation:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Organizational Issues: Collette admitted to potentially losing track of critical documents, stating she couldn't recall if \"Andy\" had sent them previously. This is particularly concerning given that email inboxes have search functions, suggesting a lack of basic organizational skills crucial for a thorough investigation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Questionable Professional Affiliation: Collette used an @aol.com email address, not one associated with the Educational Service Center of Central Ohio (ESCCO), the agency FCS claims they hired. This raises questions about her official capacity and the legitimacy of her engagement.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Overextension and Lack of Focus: Collette mentioned being \"involved with several investigations\" and losing track of materials. This admission reinforces concerns about her ability to give full attention to each case, potentially compromising the quality and accuracy of her findings. </p> </li> <li> <p>Inadequate Preparation: The email indicates that as of November 26, Collette did not have access to district manuals, which are hundreds of pages long. Yet, she began conducting interviews the very next day, raising serious doubts about her preparedness and understanding of the district's policies and procedures.</p> </li> <li> <p>Inherent Bias in Information Gathering: Given Superintendent Hatton's instructions to FCS administrators to suppress positive testimony, there's a concern that Collette may have been \"teaching to the test\" - only documenting negative information that aligned with a predetermined narrative.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Summary</p> <p>These revelations significantly undermine the credibility of the investigation. They suggest not only a lack of professional rigor in the investigative process but also raise questions about the objectivity and completeness of the findings. The absence of recorded interviews, combined with these organizational and preparatory shortcomings, casts serious doubt on the reliability of the investigation's conclusions and the fairness of any actions taken based on its findings.  </p> <p></p> <p>Documents Missing</p> <p>The documents referenced in the email as being forwarded by FHS Principal Meg Simon were not turned over by FCS. They should have been included in the discovery if they were attached in the previous email the investigator referenced. </p>"},{"location":"sections/Key%20Information%20from%20the%20PIR.html#fcs-administrations-problematic-handling-of-the-ffe-investigation","title":"FCS Administration's Problematic Handling of the FFE Investigation","text":"<p>This analysis highlights three key issues in the Findlay City Schools (FCS) administration's management of the FFE investigation: lack of communication, inconsistent decision-making, and questionable integrity in the process.</p>"},{"location":"sections/Key%20Information%20from%20the%20PIR.html#1-failure-to-communicate-with-ffe-parents","title":"1.

It also helps to establish that the expert is not just some random person off the street but has a solid background in the relevant field. </li> <li>By requiring a CV, the investigation is more likely to be thorough and well-researched, as the expert's qualifications have been properly vetted.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The investigator explicitly established the preponderance of evidence standard in the report, consistently applying this civil procedure <sup>4</sup>rule to substantiate the allegations within; So too, must the procedural rules be applied when assessing the factual accuracy of the report and the credibility of the investigator, agreed?</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Would an expert investigator typically use proper and professional language, including correct anatomical descriptions or objects imitating those parts, in an investigative report, and could the use of <sup>5</sup>slang terms or incorrect terminology undermine the credibility of the report and the investigator?</li> <li>Why did Ms. Collette commence her investigation into FFE and CKM prior to ESCCA being contacted? <ul> <li>In Ms. Collette\u2019s report, she stated she \u201cinterviewed twenty-seven witnesses between November 27, 2023 and December 6, 2023.\u201d However, in an article published in <sup>6</sup>The Courier on December 8, 2023, Joseph Weitz, the spokesperson for the ESCCA, stated they were contacted on November 28, 2023 \u2014 a day after Ms. Collette claimed to have started investigating FFE and CKM.</li> </ul> </li> <li>How was Ms. Collette able to be prepared enough to interview witnesses for an alleged ESCCA investigation on December 6 when ESCCA claims no knowledge of the reason for the investigation to The Courier on December 8?<ul> <li>In Ms. Collette\u2019s report, she stated she \u201cinterviewed twenty-seven witnesses between November 27, 2023 and December 6, 2023.\u201d According to the article published in The Courier on December 8, 2023, Joseph Weitz, spokesperson for the ESCCA, stated they had no documents indicating the reason for the investigation into FFE or CKM. This article was written two days after Ms. Collette claimed she completed 27 witness interviews.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Could you clarify why the investigative report should not be disregarded, considering the lack of transparency, the inability to establish the investigator's credibility, and the discrepancies in the timeline that cast doubt on the accuracy and reliability of the entire report?</p> <ul> <li>An argument can be made that the investigative report should be discarded  due to the following reasons:<ul> <li>The absence of any record of Janice Collette as an employee or external consultant at the Educational Service Center of Central Ohio raises questions about her qualifications and credibility as an investigator.</li> <li>The absence of a curriculum vitae for Ms. Colette, in conjunction with the failure to establish her competence in conducting the investigation, contravenes the standard requirement in both legal and non-legal investigations to ensure objectivity and credibility.</li> <li>The report's assertion that Ms. Collette commenced her investigation on November 27, 2023, and continued interviewing witnesses until December 6, 2023, stands in stark contrast to the ESCCA\u2019s claim of being contacted on November 28, 2023, and remaining uninformed of the investigation's purpose on December 8, 2023. This glaring discrepancy casts substantial doubt upon the legitimacy of the investigative process and the credibility of the report itself.</li> <li>The absence of Ms. Collette's contact information, coupled with the lack of transparency surrounding her selection as an investigator, serve to further undermine the credibility of the report.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Why would FCS school board adopt a report containing verifiable errors as an acceptable report when it would not tolerate such errors from an FCS student?</p> </li> <li>What would be the consequences for releasing a flawed investigative report to the public, considering the potential damage to reputation, legal action, financial impact, and the need for policy changes and community response?</li> <li>Who would be held responsible and face consequences for not only accepting the findings of a flawed report, but also approving its public release, and what types of consequences might they face?</li> </ul> <p>Reply we received from Chris Aldrich, FCS Board President</p> <p>\"I fully support the decisions and actions of our Superintendent, Assistant Superintendent and our Building Principal, and I am proud of the actions that they took to ensure the integrity of FFE.\"</p> <p>Note</p> <p>None of the questions raised in our letter have been answered to this day.</p> <ol> <li> <p>National Labor Relations Board, \"Interfering with Employee Rights: Section 7 &amp; 8(a)(1),\" https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/the-law/interfering-with-employee-rights-section-7-8a1 (accessed January 27, 2024).\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Ohio Revised Code, Chapter 4117, Public Employees' Collective Bargaining, https://codes.ohio.gov/ohio-revised-code/chapter-4117 (accessed January 27, 2024).\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>ESC of Central Ohio, Staff Directory, (2024), https://www.escco.org/StaffDirectory.aspx.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Cornell Law School Legal Information Institute, Federal Rules of Evidence, Rule 301 (2024), https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_301.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>\"Findlay City School District Investigation Report, First Edition Show Choir, Page 7: Sexual overtones.\"\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>\"Choir investigation costs district.\" The Courier, 8 Dec. 2023, https://thecourier.com/news/494278/choir-investigation-costs-district/.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"sections/initial_timeline.html","title":"Timeline of Events","text":"<p>The process of obtaining records related to the Findlay First Edition (FFE) investigation through public information requests was marked by delays, vague responses, and apparent reluctance from Findlay City Schools (FCS) administration.

On January 30, we received a reply from the FCS Board President, Chris Aldrich, which was utterly devoid of any clarification. In response, I promptly sent a follow-up email later that day, inquiring about which specific part of our letter his reply was addressing. Disappointingly, there has been no response to this follow-up.</p> <p>On February 5, I submitted a public information request, expecting a response within 10 business days. FCS Treasurer Pam Harrington acknowledged receipt of the request via email on February 9.</p> <p>A staggering 42 days passed after my public information request submission before receiving an update on March 19. The school district claimed they had only begun reviewing the records due to the volume produced, engaging an outside company to process the data. However, this company had just set up the review platform the previous week. The email vaguely promised to continue working on the documents and produce them within a couple of weeks.</p> <p>Yet, 4 weeks after this supposed \"progress update\" and a total of 71 days since the initial request, I still haven't received any of the requested information. This delay is unacceptable and demonstrates a blatant disregard for the importance of transparency and timely communication.</p> <p>It is highly suspect that it took 42 days to develop an interface for reviewing and filtering text data. With just 50 lines of code and some 'for' loops, a script utilizing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) can easily convert PDF and image contents into text (I have included an <sup>1</sup>example for reference). Moreover, email contents from Microsoft Outlook and Google Workspaces can be accessed easily through the APIs provided by both platforms.</p> <p>The delay in fulfilling my public information request, regarding an investigation completed in a mere 48 days, is nearly twice the time and is deeply concerning. The initial investigation involved in-person interviews with multiple individuals, carefully coordinating their schedules and including parents, legal or union representation, or other relevant parties.</p> <p>In President Aldrich's email, to which I have not received a response to my reply, he emphasized that the District sought to conduct an unbiased investigation into the culture and behaviors of the program. In the interest of transparency and the credibility of the investigation's findings, the actual materials examined during the investigation should also be made available for scrutiny, agreed?</p> <p>If the District's dedication to transparency isn't sufficient motivation to fulfill my request promptly, please be aware that the Ohio Revised Code offers various alternatives to ensure proper motivation. Pursuing these avenues would likely be embarrassing for the District and intensify the community's skepticism about the integrity of the investigation, which is an outcome neither of us wants to see.</p> <p>Due to the District's delay in processing my public information request, which was not initiated until 42 days after submission, I insist on receiving a precise and credible expected time of delivery by Friday, April 19, 2024.</p> <p>Sincerely, </p> <p>John R.
