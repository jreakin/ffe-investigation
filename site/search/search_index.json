When we filed a lawsuit to compel the release of information, FCS's lawyers moved to dismiss based on technical inaccuracies in our filing. Ironically, this action set a precedent that would render their own FFE investigation report insufficient by the same standards. The threshold for dismissing our lawsuit was lower than the severity of inaccuracies in their report, effectively discrediting their investigation by their own metrics. This maneuver not only highlighted their double standards but also demonstrated that if subjected to the same scrutiny, the FFE report would undoubtedly fail to stand up in court.</p> <p>Their actions begged the question: What were they so desperate to hide?</p> <p>The materials released by Findlay City Schools in July, in response to my request, reveal at best a level of incompetence that should alarm every parent, teacher, and taxpayer in our district; at worst, an orchestrated effort to gaslight parents, students, and the entire Findlay community.</p> <p>It's now clear why the administration fought so hard to suppress this information, particularly while Mr. Manley remained employed at Findlay City Schools. The documents and communications we've obtained paint a damning picture of an administration more concerned with controlling narratives than pursuing the truth.</p> <p>This report lays bare the facts that Findlay City Schools tried so hard to conceal. It exposes a web of misinformation, questionable decision-making, and potential abuse of power that strikes at the very heart of Findlay City School system's integrity.</p> <p>As you read through this report, prepare to be outraged. The level of misconduct uncovered demands not just attention, but action. It's time to hold those responsible accountable and to ensure that such a travesty never occurs again in our school district.</p> <p>Signed, </p> <p>John R.

These types of statements are often referred to as \"boilerplate\" denials or qualifications commonly used by public entities when replying to information requests. The intended purpose is to cover a wide range of potential legal and procedural issues.</p> Read Boilerplate Denials <p>Please be advised, your request is denied because it is overly broad and ambiguous. In providing a response to a request, the District is not required \u201cto do research or to identify records containing selected information\u201d or produce an entire category of records. See State ex rel. Fant v. Tober, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 63737, 1993 WL 173743, *1 (Apr. 28, 1993), aff'd, 68 Ohio St.3d 117 (1993). Instead, a requester must identify the records he or she is seeking \u201cwith reasonable clarity.\u201d State ex rel. Glasgow v. Jones, 119 Ohio St.3d 391, 2008-Ohio-4788, \u00b617. Requests for general categories of content or which seek all records \u201cregarding or related to\u201d a specified topic are overbroad. Morgan v. Strickland, 121 Ohio St.3d 600, 2009-Ohio-1901, at \u00b6 14\u201315. Likewise, requests seeking all correspondence between certain senders/recipients over expansive periods of time and/or involving vague subject matters or keywords do not permit the District sufficient clarity to identify responsive records. See Patton v. Univ. of Akron, Ct. of Cl. No. 2017-00820PQ, 2018-Ohio-1555, \u00b6 10; Hicks v. Newtown, Ct. of Cl. No. 2017-Ohio-00612-PQ, 2017-Ohio-8952, \u00b6 8. As such, your request lacks specificity and particularity, and invariably requests documents or categories of documents that do not exist or do not align with the District\u2019s record retention schedule (attached)  </p> <p>Your request is further denied in part to the extent it seeks documents and records that are protected from release in accordance with state and/or federal law. For example, records covered by the attorney-client are protected from release. This includes legal advice of any kind and communications between the District and its legal counsel. State ex rel. Leslie v. Ohio Hous. Fin. Agency, 105 Ohio St.3d 261, 2005-Ohio-1508. Similarly, any records containing either the education records or the non-directory, personally identifiable information of students are not subject to release. 20 USC 1232g (FERPA); R.C. 3319.321. Any record that \u201cdirectly relates\u201d to a student is considered the educational record of that student and is therefore confidential. 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 99.3. Id. This protection also pertains to information that, alone or in combination, is linked or linkable to a specific student that would allow a reasonable person in the school community, who does not have personal knowledge of the relevant circumstances, to identify the student with reasonable certainty. Federal law further protects from release any information requested by a person who the District reasonably believes knows the identity of the student to whom the education record relates. This further includes the personal notes of District employees and officials, which are not considered public records for the purposes of R.C. 149.43. See Hunter v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp., 10th Dist. No. 13AP-457, 2014-Ohio-5660, 16-17, 23-35.  </p> <p>Finally, your request is denied in part to the extent you seek records that do not constitute public records, are protected from release, and/or do not exist. A public office is not obligated to create records in response to a request for unrecorded or not-currently-recorded information, rather than a request for specific existing records containing such information. State ex rel. White v. Goldsberry, 85 Ohio St.3d 153, 154, 1999-Ohio-447 (a public office has \u201cno duty under R.C. 149.43 to create new records.\u201d). Additionally, the District has no obligation to identify those documents not produced or that do not exist, as this would amount to the creation of a privilege log, which the District has \u201cno duty under R.C. 149.43 to submit.\u201d State ex rel. Lanham v. DeWine, 135 Ohio St.3d 191, 2013-Ohio-199.  </p>"},{"location":"sections/Key%20Information%20from%20the%20PIR.html#suspicious-timing-crisis-intervention-team-information-shared-prior-to-reported-issues","title":"Suspicious Timing: Crisis Intervention Team Information Shared Prior to Reported Issues","text":"<p>On October 19, a significant exchange occurred between key figures in the Findlay City Schools administration:</p> <ul> <li>Sender: Assistant Superintendent</li> <li>Recipient: Dr. Hatton (Superintendent)</li> <li>Content: 'Crisis Intervention Team' pamphlet</li> </ul>"},{"location":"sections/Key%20Information%20from%20the%20PIR.html#key-observations","title":"Key Observations:","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Relevance to FFE:</p> <ul> <li>This correspondence was included in the Public Information Request (PIR) response.</li> <li>The PIR specifically requested information related to Findlay First Edition (FFE).</li> <li>Its inclusion suggests a direct connection to the FFE situation.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Timing Discrepancy:</p> <ul> <li>This exchange took place one month before any issues were officially reported.</li> <li>The timing raises questions about the administration's foreknowledge or preparation for potential FFE-related events.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Visual Evidence:</p> <ul> <li>Two images are provided as proof of this correspondence:<ol> <li>The initial information exchange</li> <li>The first page of the Crisis Intervention brochure </li> </ol> </li> </ul> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"sections/Key%20Information%20from%20the%20PIR.html#shifting-dynamics-manley-hatton-relationship-and-confirmation-of-proper-reporting","title":"Shifting Dynamics: Manley-Hatton Relationship and Confirmation of Proper Reporting","text":""},{"location":"sections/Key%20Information%20from%20the%20PIR.html#cordial-relationship-prior-to-investigation","title":"Cordial Relationship Prior to Investigation","text":"<ul> <li> <p>November 1: Kevin Manley thanked Dr. Hatton for being the Master of Ceremonies at the FFE Fall Fest.</p> <ul> <li>Notably, Manley referred to the Superintendent as \"Andy,\" indicating a friendly, informal relationship.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Post-November 10: Even after the initial meeting about FFE concerns, Manley continued to address Hatton as \"Andy.\"</p> <ul> <li>This suggests the relationship remained cordial despite emerging issues.  </li> </ul> <p></p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"sections/Key%20Information%20from%20the%20PIR.html#confirmation-of-proper-reporting-by-manley","title":"Confirmation of Proper Reporting by Manley","text":"<ul> <li>November 8: A crucial email from FCS Principal Meg Simon revealed:<ul> <li>Simon expressed a desire to discuss with Manley \"the contents of the FFE parent communication you received.\"</li> <li>This email serves as evidence that Manley properly reported issues within the show choir to the administration.</li> <li>Importantly, this correspondence was omitted from the FFE Investigation report.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"sections/Key%20Information%20from%20the%20PIR.html#significance-of-the-omission","title":"Significance of the Omission","text":"<p>The exclusion of this email from the investigation report raises serious questions about the thoroughness and impartiality of the investigation.

This oversight raised questions about the thoroughness and reliability of the investigation process.</p> <p></p> <p>Of the 27 nterviews that that investigator did not a single one was recorded. Not one. Does that sound like an incompetent investigator to you? The police, when they investigate things, record those conversations. Courts, when they ask a series of questions, there's depositions. Fact finding. Those are recorded. Every kind of investigation that has any credibility records the interviews of witnesses. It's mostly because usually well, it's twofold. One, you have a an actual record of the interaction and the inquiry. But more importantly is, you're busy asking questions. You're busy having a conversation. You don't have time to write everything down. So you record it. You go back and review the transcript and pick up on things that you might have missed or might have left out. But when you don't have that recording, when you don't have that transcript, you're really left only with what's on top of mind.</p> <p>Recent evidence has come to light that further substantiates these concerns. An email from the investigator, Janice Collette, dated November 26, reveals several troubling aspects of her approach to the investigation:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Organizational Issues: Collette admitted to potentially losing track of critical documents, stating she couldn't recall if \"Andy\" had sent them previously. This is particularly concerning given that email inboxes have search functions, suggesting a lack of basic organizational skills crucial for a thorough investigation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Questionable Professional Affiliation: Collette used an @aol.com email address, not one associated with the Educational Service Center of Central Ohio (ESCCO), the agency FCS claims they hired. This raises questions about her official capacity and the legitimacy of her engagement.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Overextension and Lack of Focus: Collette mentioned being \"involved with several investigations\" and losing track of materials.

Yet, she began conducting interviews the very next day, raising serious doubts about her preparedness and understanding of the district's policies and procedures.</p> </li> <li> <p>Inherent Bias in Information Gathering: Given Dr. Hatton's instructions to FCS administrators to suppress positive testimony, there's a concern that Collette may have been \"teaching to the test\" - only documenting negative information that aligned with a predetermined narrative.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Summary</p> <p>These revelations significantly undermine the credibility of the investigation. They suggest not only a lack of professional rigor in the investigative process but also raise questions about the objectivity and completeness of the findings.
