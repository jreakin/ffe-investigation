These types of statements are often referred to as \"boilerplate\" denials or qualifications commonly used by public entities when replying to information requests. The intended purpose is to cover a wide range of potential legal and procedural issues.</p> <p>Please be advised, your request is denied because it is overly broad and ambiguous. In providing a response to a request, the District is not required \u201cto do research or to identify records containing selected information\u201d or produce an entire category of records. See State ex rel. Fant v. Tober, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 63737, 1993 WL 173743, *1 (Apr. 28, 1993), aff'd, 68 Ohio St.3d 117 (1993). Instead, a requester must identify the records he or she is seeking \u201cwith reasonable clarity.\u201d State ex rel. Glasgow v. Jones, 119 Ohio St.3d 391, 2008-Ohio-4788, \u00b617. Requests for general categories of content or which seek all records \u201cregarding or related to\u201d a specified topic are overbroad. Morgan v. Strickland, 121 Ohio St.3d 600, 2009-Ohio-1901, at \u00b6 14\u201315. Likewise, requests seeking all correspondence between certain senders/recipients over expansive periods of time and/or involving vague subject matters or keywords do not permit the District sufficient clarity to identify responsive records. See Patton v. Univ. of Akron, Ct. of Cl. No. 2017-00820PQ, 2018-Ohio-1555, \u00b6 10; Hicks v. Newtown, Ct. of Cl. No. 2017-Ohio-00612-PQ, 2017-Ohio-8952, \u00b6 8. As such, your request lacks specificity and particularity, and invariably requests documents or categories of documents that do not exist or do not align with the District\u2019s record retention schedule (attached)  </p> <p>Your request is further denied in part to the extent it seeks documents and records that are protected from release in accordance with state and/or federal law. For example, records covered by the attorney-client are protected from release. This includes legal advice of any kind and communications between the District and its legal counsel. State ex rel. Leslie v. Ohio Hous. Fin. Agency, 105 Ohio St.3d 261, 2005-Ohio-1508. Similarly, any records containing either the education records or the non-directory, personally identifiable information of students are not subject to release. 20 USC 1232g (FERPA); R.C. 3319.321. Any record that \u201cdirectly relates\u201d to a student is considered the educational record of that student and is therefore confidential. 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 99.3. Id. This protection also pertains to information that, alone or in combination, is linked or linkable to a specific student that would allow a reasonable person in the school community, who does not have personal knowledge of the relevant circumstances, to identify the student with reasonable certainty. Federal law further protects from release any information requested by a person who the District reasonably believes knows the identity of the student to whom the education record relates. This further includes the personal notes of District employees and officials, which are not considered public records for the purposes of R.C. 149.43. See Hunter v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp., 10th Dist. No. 13AP-457, 2014-Ohio-5660, 16-17, 23-35.</p> <p>Finally, your request is denied in part to the extent you seek records that do not constitute public records, are protected from release, and/or do not exist. A public office is not obligated to create records in response to a request for unrecorded or not-currently-recorded information, rather than a request for specific existing records containing such information. State ex rel. White v. Goldsberry, 85 Ohio St.3d 153, 154, 1999-Ohio-447 (a public office has \u201cno duty under R.C. 149.43 to create new records.\u201d). Additionally, the District has no obligation to identify those documents not produced or that do not exist, as this would amount to the creation of a privilege log, which the District has \u201cno duty under R.C. 149.43 to submit.\u201d State ex rel. Lanham v. DeWine, 135 Ohio St.3d 191, 2013-Ohio-199.</p>"},{"location":"sections/Key%20Information%20from%20the%20PIR/#what-is-not-in-the-information-requested-from-findlay-city-schools","title":"What is not in the information requested from Findlay City Schools","text":"<ol> <li>Investigator Contract Absent<ul> <li>No contract or agreement was provided showing the terms of engagement between Findlay City Schools and the investigator or investigative agency.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Lack of 'Culture' Issue Details<ul> <li>The response did not include specific information about the alleged \"culture\" issues within Findlay First Edition (FFE).</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Note: While many documents were heavily redacted to protect individual privacy, any existing documents describing cultural problems should have been included, even if partially redacted.</p>"},{"location":"sections/Key%20Information%20from%20the%20PIR/#these-omissions-are-significant-because","title":"These omissions are significant because:","text":"<ul> <li>The missing contract raises questions about the scope and parameters of the investigation.</li> <li>The absence of details about cultural issues leaves the nature and extent of the problems unclear, despite being a central concern in the investigation.  </li> </ul>"},{"location":"sections/Key%20Information%20from%20the%20PIR/#on-october-19-krista-crates-miller-sent-a-crisis-intervention-team-pamphlet-to-dr-hatton","title":"On October 19, Krista Crates-Miller sent a 'Crisis Intervention Team' pamphlet to Dr. Hatton","text":"<ul> <li>As the PIR exclusively related to anything within the critiera I sent over, this correspondence is related to FFE.</li> <li>This is being distributed between Crates-Miller and Dr. Hatton one month prior to any reported issues. </li> </ul>"},{"location":"sections/Key%20Information%20from%20the%20PIR/#tone-of-interactions-between-dr-hatton-and-mr-manley-was-cordial-up-until-november-10","title":"Tone of interactions between Dr. Hatton and Mr. Manley was cordial up until November 10.","text":"<ul> <li>In an email on Nov 1, Kevin Manley thanked Dr. Hatton for being the Master of Ceremonies of the FFE Fall FEst, referring to the Superintendent as \"Andy\". </li> <li> <p>After the initial meeting about the concerns around FFE between Hatton and Manley on November 10, Kevin was still calling the Superintendent \"Andy\". </p> </li> <li> <p>In a November 8 email, FCS Principal Meg Simon expressed a desire to sit down with Kevin Manley about \"the contents of the FFE parent communication you received\".
