<div><h1 id="explanation-of-approach-to-lawsuit-against-findlay-city-schools">Explanation of Approach to Lawsuit Against Findlay City Schools</h1>
<h3 id="background-and-motivation">Background and Motivation</h3>
<p>After receiving an unsatisfactory response from Findlay City Schools (FCS) regarding the credibility of their investigation, despite glaring factual inaccuracies, and facing what appeared to be obstruction in obtaining requested information through a public information request, Eakin filed a lawsuit in May 2024. The goal was to compel FCS to produce the requested documents.</p>
<h3 id="strategic-approach">Strategic Approach</h3>
<p>Eakin's methodology in approaching the lawsuit was deliberately designed to mirror FCS's approach when presented with factual inaccuracies in their own investigation report. This strategy was intended to highlight the double standard in how accuracy and credibility were being treated.</p>
<h3 id="initial-filing-and-response">Initial Filing and Response</h3>
<ol>
<li>Eakin filed the initial lawsuit pro se (representing himself without a lawyer).</li>
<li>FCS's lawyers responded with a motion to dismiss, citing tech inaccuracies in Eakin's original filing.</li>
<li>Eakin, aware that his non-professional legal filing might contain imperfections, chose not to correct these issues.</li>

<h3 id="mirroring-fcss-approach">Mirroring FCS's Approach</h3>
<p>Instead of modifying or updating the lawsuit to address the cited inaccuracies, Eakin deliberately chose to maintain his original filing. This decision was made to parallel FCS's own stance of supporting their investigation report despite its flaws. Eakin insisted that the issues raised were merely technical, not factual, mirroring the school district's defense of their own report.</p>
<h3 id="notable-observations">Notable Observations</h3>
<ol>
<li>FCS's motion to dismiss did not deny or dispute any of Eakin's accusations regarding obstruction, stonewalling, or speculated motivations.</li>
<li>The focus of FCS's response was solely on procedural flaws in Eakin's suit, not on the substance of his claims.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="outcome-and-implications">Outcome and Implications</h3>
<ol>
<li>The court granted the motion to dismiss based on the technical inaccuracies in Eakin's filing.</li>
<li>The threshold for dismissing the lawsuit was lower than the level severities within the FCS's FFE investigation report.</li>
<li>This outcome suggests that if Eakin's suit was deemed insufficient on technical grounds, the FFE investigation report, with its factual inaccuracies, would undoubtedly not stand up to scrutiny either.</li>

<h1 id="what-findlay-city-schools-denied-to-providing-in-response-to-my-public-information-request">What Findlay City Schools Denied To Providing In Response To My Public Information Request</h1>
<p>The denial responses received to the public information request are standard. These types of statements are often referred to as "boilerplate" denials or qualifications commonly used by public entities when replying to information requests. The intended purpose is to cover a wide range of potential legal and procedural issues.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please be advised, your request is denied because it is overly broad and ambiguous. In providing a response to a request, the District is not required “to do research or to identify records containing selected information” or produce an entire category of records. See State ex rel. Fant v. Tober, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 63737, 1993 WL 173743, *1 (Apr. 28, 1993), aff'd, 68 Ohio St.3d 117 (1993). Instead, a requester must identify the records he or she is seeking “with reasonable clarity.” State ex rel. Glasgow v. Jones, 119 Ohio St.3d 391, 2008-Ohio-4788, ¶17. Requests for general categories of content or which seek all records “regarding or related to” a specified topic are overbroad. Morgan v. Strickland, 121 Ohio St.3d 600, 2009-Ohio-1901, at ¶ 14–15. Likewise, requests seeking all correspondence between certain senders/recipients over expansive periods of time and/or involving vague subject matters or keywords do not permit the District sufficient clarity to identify responsive records. See Patton v. Univ. of Akron, Ct. of Cl. No. 2017-00820PQ, 2018-Ohio-1555, ¶ 10; Hicks v. Newtown, Ct. of Cl. No. 2017-Ohio-00612-PQ, 2017-Ohio-8952, ¶ 8. As such, your request lacks specificity and particularity, and invariably requests documents or categories of documents that do not exist or do not align with the District’s record retention schedule (attached)  </p>
<p>Your request is further denied in part to the extent it seeks documents and records that are protected from release in accordance with state and/or federal law. For example, records covered by the attorney-client are protected from release. This includes legal advice of any kind and communications between the District and its legal counsel. State ex rel. Leslie v. Ohio Hous. Fin. Agency, 105 Ohio St.3d 261, 2005-Ohio-1508. Similarly, any records containing either the education records or the non-directory, personally identifiable information of students are not subject to release. 20 USC 1232g (FERPA); R.C. 3319.321. Any record that “directly relates” to a student is considered the educational record of that student and is therefore confidential. 34 C.F.R. § 99.3. Id. This protection also pertains to information that, alone or in combination, is linked or linkable to a specific student that would allow a reasonable person in the school community, who does not have personal knowledge of the relevant circumstances, to identify the student with reasonable certainty. Federal law further protects from release any information requested by a person who the District reasonably believes knows the identity of the student to whom the education record relates. This further includes the personal notes of District employees and officials, which are not considered public records for the purposes of R.C. 149.43. See Hunter v. Ohio Bur. of Workers’ Comp., 10th Dist. No. 13AP-457, 2014-Ohio-5660, 16-17, 23-35.</p>
<p>Finally, your request is denied in part to the extent you seek records that do not constitute public records, are protected from release, and/or do not exist. A public office is not obligated to create records in response to a request for unrecorded or not-currently-recorded information, rather than a request for specific existing records containing such information. State ex rel. White v. Goldsberry, 85 Ohio St.3d 153, 154, 1999-Ohio-447 (a public office has “no duty under R.C. 149.43 to create new records.”). Additionally, the District has no obligation to identify those documents not produced or that do not exist, as this would amount to the creation of a privilege log, which the District has “no duty under R.C. 149.43 to submit.” State ex rel. Lanham v. DeWine, 135 Ohio St.3d 191, 2013-Ohio-199.</p>

<ul>
<li>In an email on Nov 1, Kevin Manley thanked Dr. Hatton for being the Master of Ceremonies of the FFE Fall FEst, referring to the Superintendent as "Andy". </li>
<li>
<p>After the initial meeting about the concerns around FFE between Hatton and Manley on November 10, Kevin was still calling the Superintendent "Andy".<br>

</li>
<li>
<p>In a November 8 email, FCS Principal Meg Simon expressed a desire to sit down with Kevin Manley about "the contents of the FFE parent communication you received". This email confirms Mr. Manley properly reported issues within the show choir, correspondence that was intentionally omitted from the FFE Investigation report, as discussed in my original walkthrough of the inaccuracies and omissions by the investigator.<br>

<ul>
<li>In a text message to principal Meg Simon, Hatton states "I think it's best we navigate this together as it's (sic) hits close to home for Krista."  </li>
<li>When something "hits close to home," it often means the person has strong feelings or opinions about the matter, which can lead to unconscious or conscious bias in their approach to handing the matter.  </li>
<li>Conflict of interest: Hatton implicity acknowledges Crates-Miller has difficulty separating her personal feelings from her professional responsibilities.  </li>
<li>Acknowledging ethical conundrums: Ethical Considerations: One can infer Hatton is asserting Crates-Miller is recused from any matter relating to the "FFE problem" from that point forward, to maintain the integrity of the process.

<li>On December 3 an individual reached out requesting to speak to the investigator. FHS Principal Meg Simon asked Dr. Hatton how to handle the situation, and Hatton instructed her to probe into the nature of the inquiry. He instructed Simon that if the person "just want to give a ringing endorsement to Kevin, that's fine but she can send an email."<ul>
<li>This reinforces the concern that the FFE investigation was intended only to provide negative outcomes related to Kevin Manley's show choir, and positive or supportive feedback would be disregarded.<br>

<li>
<p>In a January 16 email, Dr. Hatton suggests Mr. Manley come up with "ideas you have to address the concerns you are away of to enhance the culture of FFE in both the short and long term."</p>
<ul>
<li>Seems odd for Dr. Hatton to have the individual responsible for the alleged degradation of FFE culture come up with solutions to improve it?<br>

<li>
<p>In a January 12 email, Dr. Hatton stated "I need to stick to my word that Kevin cannot return to rehearsals/directing until this thing is done."</p>
