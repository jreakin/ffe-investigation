# Uncovering the Truth: The Findlay First Edition Investigation

Dear Reader,

What began as a quest for answers in January 2024 has evolved into an expos√© of a system that appears designed to protect its own interests at the expense of truth and the well-being of students and staff.

For months, Findlay City Schools engaged in a calculated campaign of delays, legal maneuvers, and outright obstruction to prevent the release of crucial information. Their actions begged the question: **What were they so desperate to hide?**

At best, we've uncovered a level of incompetence that should alarm every parent, teacher, and taxpayer in our district. At worst, and far more disturbingly, the evidence points to a deliberate conspiracy to gaslight parents, students, and the entire Findlay community.

It's now clear why the administration fought so hard to suppress this information, particularly while Mr. Manley remained employed at Findlay City Schools. The documents and communications we've obtained paint a damning picture of an administration more concerned with controlling narratives than pursuing the truth.

This report lays bare the facts that Findlay City Schools tried so hard to conceal. It exposes a web of misinformation, questionable decision-making, and potential abuse of power that strikes at the very heart of Findlay City School system's integrity.

As you read through this report, prepare to be outraged. The level of misconduct uncovered demands not just attention, but action. It's time to hold those responsible accountable and to ensure that such a travesty never occurs again in our school district.

Signed,
