# Uncovering the Truth: The Findlay First Edition Investigation

Dear Reader,

What began as a quest for answers in January 2024 has evolved into an expos√© of a system that appears designed to protect its own interests at the expense of truth and the well-being of students and staff.

For months, Findlay City Schools engaged in a calculated campaign of [delays, legal maneuvers, and outright obstruction](./sections/initial_timeline.md) to prevent the release of crucial information. 

[Our legal approach](./sections/Approach%20to%20FCS%20Lawsuit.md) further exposed the administration's hypocrisy. When we filed a lawsuit to compel the release of information, FCS's lawyers moved to dismiss based on technical inaccuracies in our filing. Ironically, this action set a precedent that would render their own FFE investigation report insufficient by the same standards. The threshold for dismissing our lawsuit was lower than the severity of inaccuracies in their report, effectively discrediting their investigation by their own metrics. This maneuver not only highlighted their double standards but also demonstrated that if subjected to the same scrutiny, the FFE report would undoubtedly fail to stand up in court.

Their actions begged the question: **What were they so desperate to hide?**

The materials released by Findlay City Schools in July, in response to my request, reveal at best a level of incompetence that should alarm every parent, teacher, and taxpayer in our district; at worst, an orchestrated effort to gaslight parents, students, and the entire Findlay community.

It's now clear why the administration fought so hard to suppress this information, particularly while Mr. Manley remained employed at Findlay City Schools. The documents and communications we've obtained paint a damning picture of an administration more concerned with controlling narratives than pursuing the truth.

This report lays bare the facts that Findlay City Schools tried so hard to conceal. It exposes a web of misinformation, questionable decision-making, and potential abuse of power that strikes at the very heart of Findlay City School system's integrity.

As you read through this report, prepare to be outraged. The level of misconduct uncovered demands not just attention, but action. It's time to hold those responsible accountable and to ensure that such a travesty never occurs again in our school district.

Signed,
