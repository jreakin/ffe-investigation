The process of obtaining records related to the Findlay First Edition (FFE) investigation through public information requests was marked by delays, vague responses, and apparent reluctance from Findlay City Schools (FCS) administration. This timeline illustrates the challenges faced in accessing public information.

### Initial Inquiry and Formal Request

- January 29, 2024: John Eakin and his father send a letter to the Findlay School Board seeking clarification on the FFE investigation report.
- January 30, 2024: FCS Board President responds with a generic message, failing to address specific questions.
- February 5, 2024: Faced with inadequate responses, Mr. Eakin files a formal Public Information Request (PIR) for specific documents related to the FFE investigation.
- February 9, 2024: FCS Board members open the PIR email multiple times, indicating awareness of the request.

### Delays and Vague Promises

- March 19, 2024 (46 days after request):
	- FCS Treasurer breaks the silence, citing delays due to setting up a document review platform.
	- Promise made to deliver records within "a couple of weeks."
	- Estimate of approximately 1,500 relevant documents provided.

- April 17, 2024 (76 days after request):
	- After another month of silence, Mr. Eakin sends a follow-up letter requesting an update.
	- He emphasizes the relative ease of processing such requests with readily available tools.

- May 1, 2024 (90 days after request):
	- FCS Treasurer responds, contradicting the earlier "couple of weeks" estimate.
	- Claims the law only requires a "reasonable timeframe" for response.
	- Simple calculations reveal a concerningly slow review pace of about 17 minutes per day. 
	
This protracted process not only hindered timely access to public information but also raised concerns about the administration's commitment to transparency and accountability. The delays and shifting explanations suggested FCS was attempting attempting to control the narrative or possibly conceal information related to the FFE investigation.
