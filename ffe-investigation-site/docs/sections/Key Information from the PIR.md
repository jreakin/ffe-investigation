# Explanation of Approach to Lawsuit Against Findlay City Schools

### Background and Motivation

After receiving an unsatisfactory response from Findlay City Schools (FCS) regarding the credibility of their investigation, despite glaring factual inaccuracies, and facing what appeared to be obstruction in obtaining requested information through a public information request, Eakin filed a lawsuit in May 2024. The goal was to compel FCS to produce the requested documents.

### Strategic Approach

Eakin's methodology in approaching the lawsuit was deliberately designed to mirror FCS's approach when presented with factual inaccuracies in their own investigation report. This strategy was intended to highlight the double standard in how accuracy and credibility were being treated.

### Initial Filing and Response

1. Eakin filed the initial lawsuit pro se (representing himself without a lawyer).
2. FCS's lawyers responded with a motion to dismiss, citing tech inaccuracies in Eakin's original filing.
3. Eakin, aware that his non-professional legal filing might contain imperfections, chose not to correct these issues.

### Mirroring FCS's Approach

Instead of modifying or updating the lawsuit to address the cited inaccuracies, Eakin deliberately chose to maintain his original filing. This decision was made to parallel FCS's own stance of supporting their investigation report despite its flaws. Eakin insisted that the issues raised were merely technical, not factual, mirroring the school district's defense of their own report.

### Notable Observations

1. FCS's motion to dismiss did not deny or dispute any of Eakin's accusations regarding obstruction, stonewalling, or speculated motivations.
2. The focus of FCS's response was solely on procedural flaws in Eakin's suit, not on the substance of his claims.

### Outcome and Implications

1. The court granted the motion to dismiss based on the technical inaccuracies in Eakin's filing.
2. The threshold for dismissing the lawsuit was lower than the level severities within the FCS's FFE investigation report.
3. This outcome suggests that if Eakin's suit was deemed insufficient on technical grounds, the FFE investigation report, with its factual inaccuracies, would undoubtedly not stand up to scrutiny either.

# What Findlay City Schools Denied To Providing In Response To My Public Information Request
The denial responses received to the public information request are standard. These types of statements are often referred to as "boilerplate" denials or qualifications commonly used by public entities when replying to information requests. The intended purpose is to cover a wide range of potential legal and procedural issues.

> Please be advised, your request is denied because it is overly broad and ambiguous. In providing a response to a request, the District is not required “to do research or to identify records containing selected information” or produce an entire category of records. See State ex rel. Fant v. Tober, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 63737, 1993 WL 173743, *1 (Apr. 28, 1993), aff'd, 68 Ohio St.3d 117 (1993). Instead, a requester must identify the records he or she is seeking “with reasonable clarity.” State ex rel. Glasgow v. Jones, 119 Ohio St.3d 391, 2008-Ohio-4788, ¶17. Requests for general categories of content or which seek all records “regarding or related to” a specified topic are overbroad. Morgan v. Strickland, 121 Ohio St.3d 600, 2009-Ohio-1901, at ¶ 14–15. Likewise, requests seeking all correspondence between certain senders/recipients over expansive periods of time and/or involving vague subject matters or keywords do not permit the District sufficient clarity to identify responsive records. See Patton v. Univ. of Akron, Ct. of Cl. No. 2017-00820PQ, 2018-Ohio-1555, ¶ 10; Hicks v. Newtown, Ct. of Cl. No. 2017-Ohio-00612-PQ, 2017-Ohio-8952, ¶ 8. As such, your request lacks specificity and particularity, and invariably requests documents or categories of documents that do not exist or do not align with the District’s record retention schedule (attached)  


> Your request is further denied in part to the extent it seeks documents and records that are protected from release in accordance with state and/or federal law. For example, records covered by the attorney-client are protected from release. This includes legal advice of any kind and communications between the District and its legal counsel. State ex rel. Leslie v. Ohio Hous. Fin. Agency, 105 Ohio St.3d 261, 2005-Ohio-1508. Similarly, any records containing either the education records or the non-directory, personally identifiable information of students are not subject to release. 20 USC 1232g (FERPA); R.C. 3319.321. Any record that “directly relates” to a student is considered the educational record of that student and is therefore confidential. 34 C.F.R. § 99.3. Id. This protection also pertains to information that, alone or in combination, is linked or linkable to a specific student that would allow a reasonable person in the school community, who does not have personal knowledge of the relevant circumstances, to identify the student with reasonable certainty. Federal law further protects from release any information requested by a person who the District reasonably believes knows the identity of the student to whom the education record relates. This further includes the personal notes of District employees and officials, which are not considered public records for the purposes of R.C. 149.43. See Hunter v. Ohio Bur. of Workers’ Comp., 10th Dist. No. 13AP-457, 2014-Ohio-5660, 16-17, 23-35.  


> Finally, your request is denied in part to the extent you seek records that do not constitute public records, are protected from release, and/or do not exist. A public office is not obligated to create records in response to a request for unrecorded or not-currently-recorded information, rather than a request for specific existing records containing such information. State ex rel. White v. Goldsberry, 85 Ohio St.3d 153, 154, 1999-Ohio-447 (a public office has “no duty under R.C. 149.43 to create new records.”). Additionally, the District has no obligation to identify those documents not produced or that do not exist, as this would amount to the creation of a privilege log, which the District has “no duty under R.C. 149.43 to submit.” State ex rel. Lanham v. DeWine, 135 Ohio St.3d 191, 2013-Ohio-199.

# What is **not** in the information requested from Findlay City Schools
1. **Investigator Contract Absent**
	- No contract or agreement was provided showing the terms of engagement between Findlay City Schools and the investigator or investigative agency.
2. **Lack of 'Culture' Issue Details**
	- The response did not include specific information about the alleged "culture" issues within Findlay First Edition (FFE).

*Note: While many documents were heavily redacted to protect individual privacy, any existing documents describing cultural problems should have been included, even if partially redacted.*

## These omissions are significant because:
- The missing contract raises questions about the scope and parameters of the investigation.
- The absence of details about cultural issues leaves the nature and extent of the problems unclear, despite being a central concern in the investigation.

## Suspicious Timing: Crisis Intervention Team Information Shared Prior to Reported Issues
On October 19, a significant exchange occurred between key figures in the Findlay City Schools administration:

- **Sender**: Krista Crates-Miller
- **Recipient**: Dr. Hatton (Superintendent)
- **Content**: 'Crisis Intervention Team' pamphlet

### Key Observations:

1. **Relevance to FFE**:
	- This correspondence was included in the Public Information Request (PIR) response.
	- The PIR specifically requested information related to Findlay First Edition (FFE).
	- Its inclusion suggests a direct connection to the FFE situation.

2. **Timing Discrepancy**:
	- This exchange took place one month before any issues were officially reported.
	- The timing raises questions about the administration's foreknowledge or preparation for potential FFE-related events.


3. **Visual Evidence**:
	- Two images are provided as proof of this correspondence:
		1. The initial information exchange
		2. The first page of the Crisis Intervention brochure  
![](../images/Oct%2019%20-%20Crisis%20Intervention%20Info.png)  
![](../images/Oct%2019%20-%20Crisis%20Brochure%20Page%201.png)


## Shifting Dynamics: Manley-Hatton Relationship and Confirmation of Proper Reporting

### Cordial Relationship Prior to Investigation

- **November 1**: Kevin Manley thanked Dr. Hatton for being the Master of Ceremonies at the FFE Fall Fest.
	- Notably, Manley referred to the Superintendent as "Andy," indicating a friendly, informal relationship.

- **Post-November 10**: Even after the initial meeting about FFE concerns, Manley continued to address Hatton as "Andy."
	- This suggests the relationship remained cordial despite emerging issues.
	![](../images/Nov 1 - Manley refers to Hatton as "Andy".png)

### Confirmation of Proper Reporting by Manley

- **November 8**: A crucial email from FCS Principal Meg Simon revealed:
	- Simon expressed a desire to discuss with Manley "the contents of the FFE parent communication you received."
	- This email serves as evidence that Manley properly reported issues within the show choir to the administration.
	- Importantly, this correspondence was omitted from the FFE Investigation report.

### Significance of the Omission
The exclusion of this email from the investigation report raises serious questions about the thoroughness and impartiality of the investigation. As discussed in the original analysis of the report's inaccuracies and omissions, this omission appears to be intentional and potentially misleading.

For a detailed breakdown of this issue and its implications, refer to the following video segment:  
{% include "https://youtu.be/IfcRuU7wA_U?si=HpXkRUnwjhh93Vko&t=607" %}

### Key Takeaways 
1. The initial cordial relationship between Manley and Hatton, as evidenced by informal communication.
2. Confirmation that Manley properly reported FFE issues, contradicting any claims of negligence.
3. The deliberate omission of crucial evidence from the investigation report, raising concerns about its credibility and objectivity.

## Krista Crates-Miller's Problematic Involvement in the FFE Investigation
### Initial Identification of the "FFE Problem"
- **November 2**: Crates-Miller first mentions an "FFE problem" via text message.  
![](../images/Nov%202%20-%20Krista%20Miller%20"We%20have%20an%20FFE%20problem".png)  

### Acknowledged Conflict of Interest
- **20 minutes later**: Dr. Hatton texts Principal Meg Simon, stating the issue "hits close to home for Krista."
- This acknowledgment suggests:
	1. Crates-Miller has strong personal feelings about the matter.
	2. Potential for unconscious or conscious bias in her approach.
	3. Difficulty in separating personal feelings from professional responsibilities.
	4. Implicit recusal of Crates-Miller from the "FFE problem" to maintain integrity.   
![](../images/Nov%202%20-%20Hatton%20"Close%20to%20home%20for%20Krista%20Miller".png)  

### Continued Involvement Despite Acknowledged Conflict
#### 1. Document Handling:  
- **November 20**: Dr. Hatton instructs Crates-Miller to file Kevin Manley's administrative leave notification.  
![](../images/Nov%2020%20-%20Hatton%20"For%20the%20File".png)  

#### 2. Coordination with Former Boingers Director:  
- **November 12**: Alycia (Althaus) Fox informs Meg Simon that Crates-Miller reached out about the FFE Investigation.  
![](../images/Nov%2012%20-%20Althaus%20"Krista%20Miller%20reached%20out".png)  
- Crates-Miller assists Althaus with her resignation as Boingers director.  
![](../images/Althouse%20-%20Asking%20Miller%20to%20Proofread%20Resignation%201.png)  
- Coordination of resignation announcement for maximum impact on Kevin Manley.  
![](../images/Althouse%20-%20Coordinating%20Resignation%20Release%20with%20Miller.png)  

### Inappropriate Reactions and Comments
#### 1. Reaction to Staff Support for FFE:  
- Crates-Miller's extreme reaction to Dr. Hatton's secretary wearing red in support of FFE.
- Dr. Hatton's inappropriate response: "Please don't shit your pants. That's gross."
- Notable: The secretary's position was eliminated shortly after this incident.  
![](../images/Our%20Own%20Staff%20Is%20Wearing%20Red.png)  

#### 2. Insensitive Comments about FFE Performance:  
- Dr. Hatton sends "Ts & Ps" (thoughts and prayers) when Crates-Miller attends an event where FFE is performing.
- This comment further highlights the prejudice towards FFE by those overseeing the investigation.  
![](../images/Hatton%20sends%20Ts%20and%20Ps.png)  

#### 3. Derogatory Comments about FFE Personnel:  
- **January 12**: Crates-Miller refers to Andy Hanes as the "god damn choreographer" in a text to Dr. Hatton.
- This exchange demonstrates ongoing personal bias influencing the investigation.  
![](../images/Jan%2012%20-%20Hatton%20"God%20Damn%20Choreographer".png)   

### Conclusion  
This series of events and communications demonstrates a clear pattern of inappropriate involvement and bias from Krista Crates-Miller in the FFE investigation. Despite an early acknowledgment of her conflict of interest, Crates-Miller remained deeply involved in various aspects of the situation. The communications also reveal a concerning level of prejudice and unprofessional behavior from both Crates-Miller and Dr. Hatton, raising serious questions about the objectivity and fairness of the entire investigative process.

## Dr. Hatton's Excessive Control Over Kevin Manley's Communications  
Dr. Hatton's actions during the FFE investigation reveal a pattern of micromanagement and undue control over Kevin Manley's professional interactions. This level of oversight extends beyond normal administrative procedures, potentially hampering Manley's ability to perform his duties effectively.

### 1. Controlling External Vendor Communications  
- **Date**: November 14
- **Incident**: Dr. Hatton personally approved the method and purpose of Manley's correspondence with an FFE vendor.
- **Significance**: This vendor was not an FCS employee or student, yet Hatton required his approval for communication.
- **Implication**: Suggests an unusual level of control over Manley's professional activities, even those outside the school system.
![](../images/Nov 14 - Hatton micromanaging costumes .png)  

### 2. Interfering with Routine Teaching Tasks  
- **Date**: November 14
- **Incident**: FCS Principal Meg Simon had to seek Dr. Hatton's approval on how to handle lesson plan correspondence with Manley.
- **Significance**: Lesson planning is a routine task that typically doesn't require superintendent involvement.
- **Implication**: Indicates a breakdown in normal administrative procedures and an overreach of the superintendent's role.  
![](../images/Nov 14 - Simon asking Hatton how to handle lesson plans.png)

### 3. Overseeing Minor Administrative Tasks  
- **Date**: November 30
- **Incident**: FHS Principal Mark Laux required Dr. Hatton's approval to set up a Google meeting about fabric issues.
- **Significance**: Setting up meetings is a basic administrative task that shouldn't require superintendent approval.
- **Implication**: Demonstrates the extent of Hatton's involvement in even the most minor aspects of FFE-related activities.  
![](../images/Nov 30 - Hatton micromanagaes google meetings.png)

### Analysis and Implications  
1. **Disruption of Normal Operations**: Dr. Hatton's micromanagement likely caused significant delays and complications in routine school operations.
2. **Potential Bias**: This level of control suggests a predisposed attitude towards Manley, potentially compromising the fairness of the investigation.
3. **Chilling Effect**: Such oversight may have created an atmosphere of fear or hesitation among staff, potentially affecting their ability to perform their duties or provide unbiased information during the investigation.
4. **Questionable Use of Resources**: The superintendent's time and attention were diverted to minor tasks, potentially at the expense of more critical district-wide responsibilities.
5. **Procedural Irregularities**: The deviation from standard administrative practices raises questions about the motivation behind such intense scrutiny and its impact on the investigation's integrity.  

This pattern of micromanagement by Dr. Hatton reveals a concerning level of personal involvement in the FFE investigation, potentially compromising its objectivity and fairness. It also suggests a breakdown in trust and normal administrative procedures within the school district during this period.

## Dr. Hatton's Efforts to Limit Positive Testimonies in the FFE Investigation  
A concerning incident on December 3 reveals Dr. Hatton's apparent attempt to control the narrative of the FFE investigation by potentially limiting positive testimonies about Kevin Manley.

### The Incident  
- **Date**: December 3
- **Context**: An individual requested to speak with the investigator about the FFE situation.
- **Initial Response**: FHS Principal Meg Simon sought guidance from Dr. Hatton on how to handle this request.

### Dr. Hatton's Instructions  
1. **Probing Directive**: Hatton instructed Simon to investigate the nature of the individual's inquiry.
2. **Limiting Positive Testimonies**: Hatton stated, "If she just want[s] to give a ringing endorsement to Kevin, that's fine but she can send an email."  
	![](../images/Dec 3 - Hatton instructs principals to probe.png)

### Analysis of Hatton's Response  
1. **Selective Participation**: By suggesting that positive testimonies be limited to email format, Hatton appears to be creating a barrier for supporters of Manley/FFE to directly speak with the investigator.
2. **Potential Bias in Investigation**: This approach suggests a predisposition towards collecting negative information about Kevin Manley and FFE, while potentially downplaying or marginalizing positive feedback.
3. **Compromised Objectivity**: An unbiased investigation should welcome all perspectives, whether positive or negative. Hatton's instructions indicate a possible intent to shape the investigation's outcome.
4. **Procedural Irregularity**: Directing a principal to probe into the nature of a witness's testimony before allowing them to speak with the investigator is ethically questionable and could be seen as an attempt to filter information.
5. **Potential Intimidation**: Knowledge that their intent to speak would be pre-screened could discourage some supporters from coming forward, further skewing the investigation's findings.

### Implications  
1. **Integrity of the Investigation**: This incident raises serious questions about the overall fairness and comprehensiveness of the FFE investigation.
2. **Administrative Overreach**: Dr. Hatton's involvement in determining who gets to speak directly with the investigator suggests an inappropriate level of control over the investigative process.
3. **Potential for Skewed Results**: By potentially limiting direct positive testimonies, the investigation's findings could be disproportionately negative, leading to an unfair representation of Kevin Manley and FFE.
4. **Erosion of Trust**: Such actions, if known to the school community, could erode trust in the administration's ability to conduct fair and unbiased investigations.  

This incident reinforces concerns that the FFE investigation may have been conducted with a predetermined negative outcome in mind, rather than as an impartial fact-finding mission. It underscores the need for a thorough review of the investigation's methodology and findings.

## FCS Administration's Problematic Handling of the FFE Investigation  
This analysis highlights three key issues in the Findlay City Schools (FCS) administration's management of the FFE investigation: lack of communication, inconsistent decision-making, and questionable integrity in the process.

### 1. Failure to Communicate with FFE Parents  
- **Date**: December 18
- **Issue**: A parent (also an FCS employee) expressed frustration over lack of updates.
- **Key Quote**: "No update or at least a reassurance that things are still moving along."
- **Implication**: This lack of communication for over a month suggests a breakdown in transparency and potentially erodes trust between the administration and FFE families.  
![](../images/Dec 18 - Parent:Employee Reaches Out About Lack of Communication.png)

### 2. Inconsistent Approach to Addressing FFE Culture Issues  
- **Date**: January 16
- **Action**: Dr. Hatton asks Mr. Manley to propose solutions for FFE's cultural issues.
- **Key Quote**: "Ideas you have to address the concerns you are away of to enhance the culture of FFE in both the short and long term."
- **Inconsistency**: If Mr. Manley was responsible for the alleged cultural degradation, why is he being asked to propose solutions?
- **Implication**: This request raises questions about the administration's understanding of the situation and their approach to resolving it.  
  ![](../images/Jan 16 - Hatton to Manley "Come up with proposal".png)

### 3. Questionable Integrity in Decision-Making  
- **Date**: January 12
- **Statement**: Dr. Hatton emphasizes the need to "stick to my word" regarding Mr. Manley's involvement.
- **Key Quote**: "I need to stick to my word that Kevin cannot return to rehearsals/directing until this thing is done."
- **Inconsistency**: This statement contrasts with Dr. Hatton's previous actions, such as claiming an unbiased investigation to parents.
- **Implication**: This inconsistency between words and actions raises concerns about the integrity of the investigation process and Dr. Hatton's leadership.  
	![](../images/Jan 12 - Hatton "Needs to stick to his word".png)

### Analysis and Implications  
1. **Communication Breakdown**: The lack of updates to FFE parents for over a month indicates a significant failure in stakeholder communication, potentially damaging trust and transparency.
2. **Contradictory Decision-Making**: Asking Mr. Manley to propose solutions to cultural issues he's allegedly responsible for creating demonstrates inconsistent and potentially flawed problem-solving approaches.
3. **Questionable Integrity**: Dr. Hatton's emphasis on "sticking to his word" while having a history of not doing so raises serious concerns about the credibility and consistency of his leadership.
4. **Potential Bias**: These actions collectively suggest a possibly predetermined outcome for the investigation, rather than an objective fact-finding process.
5. **Stakeholder Trust**: The combination of poor communication, inconsistent decision-making, and questionable integrity likely eroded trust among FFE families, staff, and the broader school community.  

This series of events paints a picture of an administration struggling with transparency, consistency, and integrity in handling the FFE investigation. It raises significant questions about the fairness of the process and the motivations behind the administration's actions.
