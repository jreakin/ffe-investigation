### Tone of interactions between Dr. Hatton and Mr. Manley was cordial up until November 10. 
- In an email on Nov 1, Kevin Manley thanked Dr. Hatton for being the Master of Ceremonies of the FFE Fall FEst, referring to the Superintendent as "Andy". 
- After the initial meeting about the concerns around FFE between Hatton and Manley on November 10, Kevin was still calling the Superintendent "Andy". ![](website/ffe-investigation-site/docs/images/Nov 1 - Manley refers to Hatton as "Andy".png)

- In a November 8 email, FCS Principal Meg Simon expressed a desire to sit down with Kevin Manley about "the contents of the FFE parent communication you received". This email confirms Mr. Manley properly reported issues within the show choir, correspondence that was intentionally omitted from the FFE Investigation report, as discussed in my original walkthrough of the inaccuracies and omissions by the investigator ![][https://youtu.be/IfcRuU7wA_U?si=HpXkRUnwjhh93Vko&t=607]
### Dr. Hatton micromanaged the entire investigation process and who Kevin Manley could contact or correspond with
- In a November 14 email, Dr. Hatton specifically approved the method and purpose Mr. Manley would be able to correspond with a vendor of FFE. This vendor was not an employee or student within FCS, yet Hatton required his approval for Manley to correspond. ![](website/ffe-investigation-site/docs/images/Nov 14 - Hatton micromanaging costumes .png)

- In a Nov 14 email, FCS Principal Meg Simon was required to ask Dr. Hatton how to handle corresponding with Kevin Manley regarding teaching lesson plans, a uniform and regular task a high school administrator collaborates on with teachers. ![](website/ffe-investigation-site/docs/images/Nov 14 - Simon asking Hatton how to handle lesson plans.png)

- In a Nov 30 email, FHS Principle Mark Laux has to ask Dr. Hatton for approval to set up a Google meeting to discuss fabric issues. ![](website/ffe-investigation-site/docs/images/Nov 30 - Hatton micromanagaes google meetings.png)

### Dr. Hatton sought to prevent supporters of Mr. Manley/FFE from speaking with the investigator
- On December 3 an individual reached out requesting to speak to the investigator. FHS Principal Meg Simon asked Dr. Hatton how to handle the situation, and Hatton instructed her to probe into the nature of the inquiry. He instructed Simon that if the person "just want to give a ringing endorsement to Kevin, that's fine but she can send an email."
	- This reinforces the concern that the FFE investigation was intended only to provide negative outcomes related to Kevin Manley's show choir, and positive or supportive feedback would be disregarded. ![](website/ffe-investigation-site/docs/images/Dec 3 - Hatton instructs principals to probe.png)

### FCS Administration failed to communicate with FFE parents on the status of the investigation for over a month
- In an email from a parent and FCS employee on December 18, frustration was expressed for FCS administration had provided "no update or at least a reassurance that things are still moving along."![](website/ffe-investigation-site/docs/images/Dec 18 - Parent:Employee Reaches Out About Lack of Communication.png)

- In a January 16 email, Dr. Hatton suggests Mr. Manley come up with "ideas you have to address the concerns you are away of to enhance the culture of FFE in both the short and long term."
	- Seems odd for Dr. Hatton to have the individual responsible for the alleged degradation of FFE culture come up with solutions to improve it?
	  ![](website/ffe-investigation-site/docs/images/Jan 16 - Hatton to Manley "Come up with proposal".png)

- In a January 12 email, Dr. Hatton stated "I need to stick to my word that Kevin cannot return to rehearsals/directing until this thing is done."
	- Meanwhile, Hatton has a storied history of not sticking to his word, such as claiming to parents the investigation was unbiased, etc. ![](website/ffe-investigation-site/docs/images/Jan 12 - Hatton "Needs to stick to his word".png)
