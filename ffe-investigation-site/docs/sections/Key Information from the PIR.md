# Explanation of Approach to Lawsuit Against Findlay City Schools

### Background and Motivation

After receiving an unsatisfactory response from Findlay City Schools (FCS) regarding the credibility of their investigation, despite glaring factual inaccuracies, and facing what appeared to be obstruction in obtaining requested information through a public information request, Eakin filed a lawsuit in May 2024. The goal was to compel FCS to produce the requested documents.

### Strategic Approach

Eakin's methodology in approaching the lawsuit was deliberately designed to mirror FCS's approach when presented with factual inaccuracies in their own investigation report. This strategy was intended to highlight the double standard in how accuracy and credibility were being treated.

### Initial Filing and Response

1. Eakin filed the initial lawsuit pro se (representing himself without a lawyer).
2. FCS's lawyers responded with a motion to dismiss, citing tech inaccuracies in Eakin's original filing.
3. Eakin, aware that his non-professional legal filing might contain imperfections, chose not to correct these issues.

### Mirroring FCS's Approach

Instead of modifying or updating the lawsuit to address the cited inaccuracies, Eakin deliberately chose to maintain his original filing. This decision was made to parallel FCS's own stance of supporting their investigation report despite its flaws. Eakin insisted that the issues raised were merely technical, not factual, mirroring the school district's defense of their own report.

### Notable Observations

1. FCS's motion to dismiss did not deny or dispute any of Eakin's accusations regarding obstruction, stonewalling, or speculated motivations.
2. The focus of FCS's response was solely on procedural flaws in Eakin's suit, not on the substance of his claims.

### Outcome and Implications

1. The court granted the motion to dismiss based on the technical inaccuracies in Eakin's filing.
2. The threshold for dismissing the lawsuit was lower than the level severities within the FCS's FFE investigation report.
3. This outcome suggests that if Eakin's suit was deemed insufficient on technical grounds, the FFE investigation report, with its factual inaccuracies, would undoubtedly not stand up to scrutiny either.

# What Findlay City Schools Denied To Providing In Response To My Public Information Request
The denial responses received to the public information request are standard. These types of statements are often referred to as "boilerplate" denials or qualifications commonly used by public entities when replying to information requests. The intended purpose is to cover a wide range of potential legal and procedural issues.

> Please be advised, your request is denied because it is overly broad and ambiguous. In providing a response to a request, the District is not required “to do research or to identify records containing selected information” or produce an entire category of records. See State ex rel. Fant v. Tober, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 63737, 1993 WL 173743, *1 (Apr. 28, 1993), aff'd, 68 Ohio St.3d 117 (1993). Instead, a requester must identify the records he or she is seeking “with reasonable clarity.” State ex rel. Glasgow v. Jones, 119 Ohio St.3d 391, 2008-Ohio-4788, ¶17. Requests for general categories of content or which seek all records “regarding or related to” a specified topic are overbroad. Morgan v. Strickland, 121 Ohio St.3d 600, 2009-Ohio-1901, at ¶ 14–15. Likewise, requests seeking all correspondence between certain senders/recipients over expansive periods of time and/or involving vague subject matters or keywords do not permit the District sufficient clarity to identify responsive records. See Patton v. Univ. of Akron, Ct. of Cl. No. 2017-00820PQ, 2018-Ohio-1555, ¶ 10; Hicks v. Newtown, Ct. of Cl. No. 2017-Ohio-00612-PQ, 2017-Ohio-8952, ¶ 8. As such, your request lacks specificity and particularity, and invariably requests documents or categories of documents that do not exist or do not align with the District’s record retention schedule (attached)  

> Your request is further denied in part to the extent it seeks documents and records that are protected from release in accordance with state and/or federal law. For example, records covered by the attorney-client are protected from release. This includes legal advice of any kind and communications between the District and its legal counsel. State ex rel. Leslie v. Ohio Hous. Fin. Agency, 105 Ohio St.3d 261, 2005-Ohio-1508. Similarly, any records containing either the education records or the non-directory, personally identifiable information of students are not subject to release. 20 USC 1232g (FERPA); R.C. 3319.321. Any record that “directly relates” to a student is considered the educational record of that student and is therefore confidential. 34 C.F.R. § 99.3. Id. This protection also pertains to information that, alone or in combination, is linked or linkable to a specific student that would allow a reasonable person in the school community, who does not have personal knowledge of the relevant circumstances, to identify the student with reasonable certainty. Federal law further protects from release any information requested by a person who the District reasonably believes knows the identity of the student to whom the education record relates. This further includes the personal notes of District employees and officials, which are not considered public records for the purposes of R.C. 149.43. See Hunter v. Ohio Bur. of Workers’ Comp., 10th Dist. No. 13AP-457, 2014-Ohio-5660, 16-17, 23-35.

> Finally, your request is denied in part to the extent you seek records that do not constitute public records, are protected from release, and/or do not exist. A public office is not obligated to create records in response to a request for unrecorded or not-currently-recorded information, rather than a request for specific existing records containing such information. State ex rel. White v. Goldsberry, 85 Ohio St.3d 153, 154, 1999-Ohio-447 (a public office has “no duty under R.C. 149.43 to create new records.”). Additionally, the District has no obligation to identify those documents not produced or that do not exist, as this would amount to the creation of a privilege log, which the District has “no duty under R.C. 149.43 to submit.” State ex rel. Lanham v. DeWine, 135 Ohio St.3d 191, 2013-Ohio-199.

# What is *not* in the information requested from Findlay City Schools
1. Investigator Contract Absent
	- No contract or agreement was provided showing the terms of engagement between Findlay City Schools and the investigator or investigative agency.
2. Lack of 'Culture' Issue Details
	- The response did not include specific information about the alleged "culture" issues within Findlay First Edition (FFE).

*Note: While many documents were heavily redacted to protect individual privacy, any existing documents describing cultural problems should have been included, even if partially redacted.*

### These omissions are significant because:
- The missing contract raises questions about the scope and parameters of the investigation.
- The absence of details about cultural issues leaves the nature and extent of the problems unclear, despite being a central concern in the investigation.

### Suspicious Timing: Crisis Intervention Team Information Shared Prior to Reported Issues
On October 19, a significant exchange occurred between key figures in the Findlay City Schools administration:

- Sender: Krista Crates-Miller
- Recipient: Dr. Hatton (Superintendent)
- Content: 'Crisis Intervention Team' pamphlet

Key Observations:

1. Relevance to FFE:
	- This correspondence was included in the Public Information Request (PIR) response.
	- The PIR specifically requested information related to Findlay First Edition (FFE).
	- Its inclusion suggests a direct connection to the FFE situation.

2. Timing Discrepancy:
	- This exchange took place one month before any issues were officially reported.
	- The timing raises questions about the administration's foreknowledge or preparation for potential FFE-related events.


3. Visual Evidence:
	- Two images are provided as proof of this correspondence:
		1. The initial information exchange
		2. The first page of the Crisis Intervention brochure##

### Shifting Dynamics: Manley-Hatton Relationship and Confirmation of Proper Reporting

#### Cordial Relationship Prior to Investigation

- **November 1**: Kevin Manley thanked Dr. Hatton for being the Master of Ceremonies at the FFE Fall Fest.
	- Notably, Manley referred to the Superintendent as "Andy," indicating a friendly, informal relationship.

- **Post-November 10**: Even after the initial meeting about FFE concerns, Manley continued to address Hatton as "Andy."
	- This suggests the relationship remained cordial despite emerging issues.
	![](../images/Nov 1 - Manley refers to Hatton as "Andy".png)

#### Confirmation of Proper Reporting by Manley

- **November 8**: A crucial email from FCS Principal Meg Simon revealed:
	- Simon expressed a desire to discuss with Manley "the contents of the FFE parent communication you received."
	- This email serves as evidence that Manley properly reported issues within the show choir to the administration.
	- Importantly, this correspondence was omitted from the FFE Investigation report.

#### Significance of the Omission
The exclusion of this email from the investigation report raises serious questions about the thoroughness and impartiality of the investigation. As discussed in the original analysis of the report's inaccuracies and omissions, this omission appears to be intentional and potentially misleading.

For a detailed breakdown of this issue and its implications, refer to the following video segment:
{% include "https://youtu.be/IfcRuU7wA_U?si=HpXkRUnwjhh93Vko&t=607" %}

#### Key Takeaways 
1. The initial cordial relationship between Manley and Hatton, as evidenced by informal communication.
2. Confirmation that Manley properly reported FFE issues, contradicting any claims of negligence.
3. The deliberate omission of crucial evidence from the investigation report, raising concerns about its credibility and objectivity.


### Krista Crates-Miller's Problematic Involvement in the FFE Investigation
#### Initial Identification of the "FFE Problem"
- **November 2**: Crates-Miller first mentions an "FFE problem" via text message.  
![](../images/Nov%202%20-%20Krista%20Miller%20"We%20have%20an%20FFE%20problem".png)  

#### Acknowledged Conflict of Interest
- **20 minutes later**: Dr. Hatton texts Principal Meg Simon, stating the issue "hits close to home for Krista."
- This acknowledgment suggests:
	1. Crates-Miller has strong personal feelings about the matter.
	2. Potential for unconscious or conscious bias in her approach.
	3. Difficulty in separating personal feelings from professional responsibilities.
	4. Implicit recusal of Crates-Miller from the "FFE problem" to maintain integrity.   
	![](../images/Nov%202%20-%20Hatton%20"Close%20to%20home%20for%20Krista%20Miller".png)  

#### Continued Involvement Despite Acknowledged Conflict
1. **Document Handling**:
	- **November 20**: Dr. Hatton instructs Crates-Miller to file Kevin Manley's administrative leave notification.  
	![](../images/Nov%2020%20-%20Hatton%20"For%20the%20File".png)  

2. **Coordination with Former Boingers Director**:
	- **November 12**: Alycia (Althaus) Fox informs Meg Simon that Crates-Miller reached out about the FFE Investigation.  
	![](../images/Nov%2012%20-%20Althaus%20"Krista%20Miller%20reached%20out".png)  
	- Crates-Miller assists Althaus with her resignation as Boingers director.  
	![](../images/Althouse%20-%20Asking%20Miller%20to%20Proofread%20Resignation%201.png)  
	- Coordination of resignation announcement for maximum impact on Kevin Manley.  
	![](../images/Althouse%20-%20Coordinating%20Resignation%20Release%20with%20Miller.png)  

#### Inappropriate Reactions and Comments
1. **Reaction to Staff Support for FFE**:
	- Crates-Miller's extreme reaction to Dr. Hatton's secretary wearing red in support of FFE.
	- Dr. Hatton's inappropriate response: "Please don't shit your pants. That's gross."
	- Notable: The secretary's position was eliminated shortly after this incident.  
	![](../images/Our%20Own%20Staff%20Is%20Wearing%20Red.png)  

2. **Insensitive Comments about FFE Performance**:
	- Dr. Hatton sends "Ts & Ps" (thoughts and prayers) when Crates-Miller attends an event where FFE is performing.
	- This comment further highlights the prejudice towards FFE by those overseeing the investigation.  
	![](../images/Hatton%20sends%20Ts%20and%20Ps.png)  

3. **Derogatory Comments about FFE Personnel**:
	- **January 12**: Crates-Miller refers to Andy Hanes as "god damn choreographer" in a text to Dr. Hatton.
	- This exchange demonstrates ongoing personal bias influencing the investigation.  
	![](../images/Jan%2012%20-%20Hatton%20"God%20Damn%20Choreographer".png)   

#### Conclusion 
This series of events and communications demonstrates a clear pattern of inappropriate involvement and bias from Krista Crates-Miller in the FFE investigation. Despite an early acknowledgment of her conflict of interest, Crates-Miller remained deeply involved in various aspects of the situation. The communications also reveal a concerning level of prejudice and unprofessional behavior from both Crates-Miller and Dr. Hatton, raising serious questions about the objectivity and fairness of the entire investigative process.


### Dr. Hatton micromanaged the entire investigation process and who Kevin Manley could contact or correspond with
- In a November 14 email, Dr. Hatton specifically approved the method and purpose Mr. Manley would be able to correspond with a vendor of FFE. This vendor was not an employee or student within FCS, yet Hatton required his approval for Manley to correspond.   
![](../images/Nov 14 - Hatton micromanaging costumes .png)

- In a Nov 14 email, FCS Principal Meg Simon was required to ask Dr. Hatton how to handle corresponding with Kevin Manley regarding teaching lesson plans, a uniform and regular task a high school administrator collaborates on with teachers.  
![](../images/Nov 14 - Simon asking Hatton how to handle lesson plans.png)

- In a Nov 30 email, FHS Principle Mark Laux has to ask Dr. Hatton for approval to set up a Google meeting to discuss fabric issues.  
![](../images/Nov 30 - Hatton micromanagaes google meetings.png)


### Dr. Hatton sought to prevent supporters of Mr. Manley/FFE from speaking with the investigator
- On December 3 an individual reached out requesting to speak to the investigator. FHS Principal Meg Simon asked Dr. Hatton how to handle the situation, and Hatton instructed her to probe into the nature of the inquiry. He instructed Simon that if the person "just want to give a ringing endorsement to Kevin, that's fine but she can send an email."
	- This reinforces the concern that the FFE investigation was intended only to provide negative outcomes related to Kevin Manley's show choir, and positive or supportive feedback would be disregarded.  
	![](../images/Dec 3 - Hatton instructs principals to probe.png)

### FCS Administration failed to communicate with FFE parents on the status of the investigation for over a month
- In an email from a parent and FCS employee on December 18, frustration was expressed for FCS administration had provided "no update or at least a reassurance that things are still moving along."  
![](../images/Dec 18 - Parent:Employee Reaches Out About Lack of Communication.png)

- In a January 16 email, Dr. Hatton suggests Mr. Manley come up with "ideas you have to address the concerns you are away of to enhance the culture of FFE in both the short and long term."
	- Seems odd for Dr. Hatton to have the individual responsible for the alleged degradation of FFE culture come up with solutions to improve it?  
	  ![](../images/Jan 16 - Hatton to Manley "Come up with proposal".png)

- In a January 12 email, Dr. Hatton stated "I need to stick to my word that Kevin cannot return to rehearsals/directing until this thing is done."
	- Meanwhile, Hatton has a storied history of not sticking to his word, such as claiming to parents the investigation was unbiased, etc.  
	![](../images/Jan 12 - Hatton "Needs to stick to his word".png)
