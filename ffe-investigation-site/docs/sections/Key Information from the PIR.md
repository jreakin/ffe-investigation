# Explanation of Approach to Lawsuit Against Findlay City Schools

### Background and Motivation

After receiving an unsatisfactory response from Findlay City Schools (FCS) regarding the credibility of their investigation, despite glaring factual inaccuracies, and facing what appeared to be obstruction in obtaining requested information through a public information request, Eakin filed a lawsuit in May 2024. The goal was to compel FCS to produce the requested documents.

### Strategic Approach

Eakin's methodology in approaching the lawsuit was deliberately designed to mirror FCS's approach when presented with factual inaccuracies in their own investigation report. This strategy was intended to highlight the double standard in how accuracy and credibility were being treated.

### Initial Filing and Response

1. Eakin filed the initial lawsuit pro se (representing himself without a lawyer).
2. FCS's lawyers responded with a motion to dismiss, citing tech inaccuracies in Eakin's original filing.
3. Eakin, aware that his non-professional legal filing might contain imperfections, chose not to correct these issues.

### Mirroring FCS's Approach

Instead of modifying or updating the lawsuit to address the cited inaccuracies, Eakin deliberately chose to maintain his original filing. This decision was made to parallel FCS's own stance of supporting their investigation report despite its flaws. Eakin insisted that the issues raised were merely technical, not factual, mirroring the school district's defense of their own report.

### Notable Observations

1. FCS's motion to dismiss did not deny or dispute any of Eakin's accusations regarding obstruction, stonewalling, or speculated motivations.
2. The focus of FCS's response was solely on procedural flaws in Eakin's suit, not on the substance of his claims.

### Outcome and Implications

1. The court granted the motion to dismiss based on the technical inaccuracies in Eakin's filing.
2. The threshold for dismissing the lawsuit was lower than the level severities within the FCS's FFE investigation report.
3. This outcome suggests that if Eakin's suit was deemed insufficient on technical grounds, the FFE investigation report, with its factual inaccuracies, would undoubtedly not stand up to scrutiny either.

# What Findlay City Schools Denied To Providing In Response To My Public Information Request
The denial responses received to the public information request are standard. These types of statements are often referred to as "boilerplate" denials or qualifications commonly used by public entities when replying to information requests. The intended purpose is to cover a wide range of potential legal and procedural issues.

> Please be advised, your request is denied because it is overly broad and ambiguous. In providing a response to a request, the District is not required “to do research or to identify records containing selected information” or produce an entire category of records. See State ex rel. Fant v. Tober, 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 63737, 1993 WL 173743, *1 (Apr. 28, 1993), aff'd, 68 Ohio St.3d 117 (1993). Instead, a requester must identify the records he or she is seeking “with reasonable clarity.” State ex rel. Glasgow v. Jones, 119 Ohio St.3d 391, 2008-Ohio-4788, ¶17. Requests for general categories of content or which seek all records “regarding or related to” a specified topic are overbroad. Morgan v. Strickland, 121 Ohio St.3d 600, 2009-Ohio-1901, at ¶ 14–15. Likewise, requests seeking all correspondence between certain senders/recipients over expansive periods of time and/or involving vague subject matters or keywords do not permit the District sufficient clarity to identify responsive records. See Patton v. Univ. of Akron, Ct. of Cl. No. 2017-00820PQ, 2018-Ohio-1555, ¶ 10; Hicks v. Newtown, Ct. of Cl. No. 2017-Ohio-00612-PQ, 2017-Ohio-8952, ¶ 8. As such, your request lacks specificity and particularity, and invariably requests documents or categories of documents that do not exist or do not align with the District’s record retention schedule (attached)  

> Your request is further denied in part to the extent it seeks documents and records that are protected from release in accordance with state and/or federal law. For example, records covered by the attorney-client are protected from release. This includes legal advice of any kind and communications between the District and its legal counsel. State ex rel. Leslie v. Ohio Hous. Fin. Agency, 105 Ohio St.3d 261, 2005-Ohio-1508. Similarly, any records containing either the education records or the non-directory, personally identifiable information of students are not subject to release. 20 USC 1232g (FERPA); R.C. 3319.321. Any record that “directly relates” to a student is considered the educational record of that student and is therefore confidential. 34 C.F.R. § 99.3. Id. This protection also pertains to information that, alone or in combination, is linked or linkable to a specific student that would allow a reasonable person in the school community, who does not have personal knowledge of the relevant circumstances, to identify the student with reasonable certainty. Federal law further protects from release any information requested by a person who the District reasonably believes knows the identity of the student to whom the education record relates. This further includes the personal notes of District employees and officials, which are not considered public records for the purposes of R.C. 149.43. See Hunter v. Ohio Bur. of Workers’ Comp., 10th Dist. No. 13AP-457, 2014-Ohio-5660, 16-17, 23-35.

> Finally, your request is denied in part to the extent you seek records that do not constitute public records, are protected from release, and/or do not exist. A public office is not obligated to create records in response to a request for unrecorded or not-currently-recorded information, rather than a request for specific existing records containing such information. State ex rel. White v. Goldsberry, 85 Ohio St.3d 153, 154, 1999-Ohio-447 (a public office has “no duty under R.C. 149.43 to create new records.”). Additionally, the District has no obligation to identify those documents not produced or that do not exist, as this would amount to the creation of a privilege log, which the District has “no duty under R.C. 149.43 to submit.” State ex rel. Lanham v. DeWine, 135 Ohio St.3d 191, 2013-Ohio-199.

# What is *not* in the information requested from Findlay City Schools
1. Investigator Contract Absent
	- No contract or agreement was provided showing the terms of engagement between Findlay City Schools and the investigator or investigative agency.
2. Lack of 'Culture' Issue Details
	- The response did not include specific information about the alleged "culture" issues within Findlay First Edition (FFE).

*Note: While many documents were heavily redacted to protect individual privacy, any existing documents describing cultural problems should have been included, even if partially redacted.*

### These omissions are significant because:
- The missing contract raises questions about the scope and parameters of the investigation.
- The absence of details about cultural issues leaves the nature and extent of the problems unclear, despite being a central concern in the investigation.

### On _October_ 19, Krista Crates-Miller sent a 'Crisis Intervention Team' pamphlet to Dr. Hatton
- As the PIR *exclusively* related to anything within the critiera I sent over, this correspondence is related to FFE.
- This is being distributed between Crates-Miller and Dr. Hatton *one month* prior to any reported issues.  
![](../images/Oct%2019%20-%20Crisis%20Intervention%20Info.png)  
![](../images/Oct%2019%20-%20Crisis%20Brochure%20Page%201.png)


### Tone of interactions between Dr. Hatton and Mr. Manley was cordial up until November 10. 
- In an email on Nov 1, Kevin Manley thanked Dr. Hatton for being the Master of Ceremonies of the FFE Fall FEst, referring to the Superintendent as "Andy". 
- After the initial meeting about the concerns around FFE between Hatton and Manley on November 10, Kevin was still calling the Superintendent "Andy".  
![](../images/Nov 1 - Manley refers to Hatton as "Andy".png)

- In a November 8 email, FCS Principal Meg Simon expressed a desire to sit down with Kevin Manley about "the contents of the FFE parent communication you received". This email confirms Mr. Manley properly reported issues within the show choir, correspondence that was intentionally omitted from the FFE Investigation report, as discussed in my original walkthrough of the inaccuracies and omissions by the investigator.  
{% include "https://youtu.be/IfcRuU7wA_U?si=HpXkRUnwjhh93Vko&t=607"}

### Krista Crates-Miller is the first person to mention an issue related to FFE
- On November 2, Crates-Miller sent via text message "we have an FFE problem"  
![](../images/Nov%202%20-%20Krista%20Miller%20"We%20have%20an%20FFE%20problem".png)  

#### 20 minutes later, Hatton contacts an FHS principal, stating Crates-Miller is 'too close to home' on the FFE problem
- In a text message to principal Meg Simon, Hatton states "I think it's best we navigate this together as it's (sic) hits close to home for Krista."  
- When something "hits close to home," it often means the person has strong feelings or opinions about the matter, which can lead to unconscious or conscious bias in their approach to handing the matter.  
- Conflict of interest: Hatton implicity acknowledges Crates-Miller has difficulty separating her personal feelings from her professional responsibilities.  
- Acknowledging ethical conundrums: Ethical Considerations: One can infer Hatton is asserting Crates-Miller is recused from any matter relating to the "FFE problem" from that point forward, to maintain the integrity of the process.
![](../images/Nov%202%20-%20Hatton%20"Close%20to%20home%20for%20Krista%20Miller".png)  

#### Except Hatton still sent documents and information to Crates-Miller for "The file"
- An email dated November 20 from Dr. Hatton instructs Crates-Miller to place his notification of administrative leave to Kevin Manley in "the file".  
![](../images/Nov%2020%20-%20Hatton%20"For%20the%20File".png)  

#### And Crates-Miller coordinated with former director of The Boingers, Alycia (Althaus) Fox. 
- In a text message on November 12, Fox tells Meg Simon that Crates-Miller reached out to her that morning to discuss the FFE Investigation.  
![](../images/Nov%2012%20-%20Althaus%20"Krista%20Miller%20reached%20out".png)  

- Althaus also sought Crates-Miller's counsel on how to word her resignation as director of The Boingers.  
![](../images/Althouse%20-%20Asking%20Miller%20to%20Proofread%20Resignation%201.png)

- Althaus coordinated the annoucement of her resignation with Crates-Miller, to generate maximum negative impact on Kevin Manley.  
![](../images/Althouse%20-%20Coordinating%20Resignation%20Release%20with%20Miller.png)  


#### Creates-Miller 'almost shit my pants' when Dr. Hatton's Secretary Wore Red In Support of FFE
- Dr. Hatton: "Please don't shit your pants. That's gross."
- The Secretary's position was elimitated and the employee was moved to another role shortly thereafter. 
![](../images/Our%20Own%20Staff%20Is%20Wearing%20Red.png)  

#### Crates-Miller attended a women's tea where FFE was performing, Dr. Hatton sent "Ts & Ps"
- The tea was held at Gateway Church. 
- This comment by Dr. Hatton was completely out of line and further highlights the prejudice towards FFE by those coordinating and overseeing the investiation into the show choir.  
![](../images/Hatton%20sends%20Ts%20and%20Ps.png)  

#### Crates-Miller: Andy Hanes just a "god damn choreographer"
- In a text exchange with Dr. Hatton on January 12, Crates-Miller said "No offense (actually all offense) but didn't JD run the program since inception? Would he not be capable of working with a god damn choreographer without a babysitter?"
- This exchange further highlights the personal bias influecing the investigation, both by Crates-Miller continuing to comment, and Dr. Hatton refusing to halt the conversation.  
![](../images/Jan%2012%20-%20Hatton%20"God%20Damn%20Choreographer".png)


### Dr. Hatton micromanaged the entire investigation process and who Kevin Manley could contact or correspond with
- In a November 14 email, Dr. Hatton specifically approved the method and purpose Mr. Manley would be able to correspond with a vendor of FFE. This vendor was not an employee or student within FCS, yet Hatton required his approval for Manley to correspond.   
![](../images/Nov 14 - Hatton micromanaging costumes .png)

- In a Nov 14 email, FCS Principal Meg Simon was required to ask Dr. Hatton how to handle corresponding with Kevin Manley regarding teaching lesson plans, a uniform and regular task a high school administrator collaborates on with teachers.  
![](../images/Nov 14 - Simon asking Hatton how to handle lesson plans.png)

- In a Nov 30 email, FHS Principle Mark Laux has to ask Dr. Hatton for approval to set up a Google meeting to discuss fabric issues.  
![](../images/Nov 30 - Hatton micromanagaes google meetings.png)


### Dr. Hatton sought to prevent supporters of Mr. Manley/FFE from speaking with the investigator
- On December 3 an individual reached out requesting to speak to the investigator. FHS Principal Meg Simon asked Dr. Hatton how to handle the situation, and Hatton instructed her to probe into the nature of the inquiry. He instructed Simon that if the person "just want to give a ringing endorsement to Kevin, that's fine but she can send an email."
	- This reinforces the concern that the FFE investigation was intended only to provide negative outcomes related to Kevin Manley's show choir, and positive or supportive feedback would be disregarded.  
	![](../images/Dec 3 - Hatton instructs principals to probe.png)

### FCS Administration failed to communicate with FFE parents on the status of the investigation for over a month
- In an email from a parent and FCS employee on December 18, frustration was expressed for FCS administration had provided "no update or at least a reassurance that things are still moving along."  
![](../images/Dec 18 - Parent:Employee Reaches Out About Lack of Communication.png)

- In a January 16 email, Dr. Hatton suggests Mr. Manley come up with "ideas you have to address the concerns you are away of to enhance the culture of FFE in both the short and long term."
	- Seems odd for Dr. Hatton to have the individual responsible for the alleged degradation of FFE culture come up with solutions to improve it?  
	  ![](../images/Jan 16 - Hatton to Manley "Come up with proposal".png)

- In a January 12 email, Dr. Hatton stated "I need to stick to my word that Kevin cannot return to rehearsals/directing until this thing is done."
	- Meanwhile, Hatton has a storied history of not sticking to his word, such as claiming to parents the investigation was unbiased, etc.  
	![](../images/Jan 12 - Hatton "Needs to stick to his word".png)
