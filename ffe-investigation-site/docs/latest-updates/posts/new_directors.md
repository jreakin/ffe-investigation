# Unqualified and Overpaid: The Curious Case of FFE's New Directors
Following [Kevin Manley's](manley_rebuttal.md) resignation, Findlay City Schools (FCS) took an unconventional approach by hiring two directors to fill a role previously managed by a single teacher:

David Coolidge (47 years old) and his wife, Mary Beth Coolidge.

### Compensation Analysis

#### Mary Beth Coolidge's Salary
At the September 16, 2024 FCS Board Meeting,Assistant Superintendenent of Personnnel and HR, Krista Miller, informed the board of Mary Beth's salary classification:

- Step 14 pay scale (14 years of teaching experience)
- Master's Degree + 30 credit hours
- Annual compensation: $80,000 ([reference](https://go.boarddocs.com/oh/findlay/Board.nsf/files/D5AJR84AE78A/$file/Teacher%20Salary%20Schedule%202024%202025%20With%20Index.pdf))
- Ohio teaching certificate obtained in August 2024
![](../../images/mary-beth-coolidge-teaching-certificate.png)

!!! warning "Mathematical Impossibility"
    At age 35, Mary Beth Coolidge's experience timeline presents a mathematical impossibility:  

    - Step 14 implies 14 years of K-12 teaching experience
    - Would need to have started teaching at age 21 to accumulate this experience
    - Yet has documented extensive career in:
        - Opera performance
        - Higher education
        - Performing arts

    This makes the Step 14 classification mathematically impossible, and no evidence exists of any concurrent K-12 teaching positions during her documented opera and higher education career.

#### David Coolidge's Compensation
At the June 18, 2024 FCS Board Meeting, Assistant Superintendenent of Personnnel and HR, Krista Miller, informed the board they agreed to pay David Coolidge:  

- Step 22 pay scale (22 years of teaching experience)
- Master's Degree + 30 credit hours
- Annual compensation $88,337 ([reference](https://go.boarddocs.com/oh/findlay/Board.nsf/files/D6CPAC63A695/$file/Assistant%20Superintendent%20of%20Personnel%20and%20HR%20Consent%20Items.pdf))
- Without a teaching certificate issued by the Ohio Department of Education at time of publication.  

!!! warning "Mathematical Impossibility"
    At age 47, for Coolidge to have accumulated the experience claimed:  

    - 25 years as a freelance artist (starting at age 22)
    - 10 years in higher education
    - Would total 35 years of experience

    This experience-based pay scale is mathematically impossible, and no evidence exists of any concurrent K-12 teaching positions during his documented freelance and higher education career.

!!! danger "Unqualified Yet Highly Compensated"
    More critically, FCS has placed him at Step 22 on the teacher pay scale—implying 22 years of K-12 teaching experience—despite having:

    - No Ohio teaching license
    - No documented K-12 teaching experience
    - No evidence of prior school district employment
<br>

**Comparative Compensation**  

- Previous Director (Kevin Manley): Approximately $91,000 with 33+ years of teaching experience  
- Current Leadership (Coolidge Couple): Combined salary of nearly $180,000  

The significant increase in administrative costs for what was previously a single director's role raises questions about the district's financial decision-making.  


!!! abstract "Key Takeaways"
    The official board documents and state records reveal concerning discrepancies in the Coolidges' salary classifications:

    **Mary Beth Coolidge's Classification**  

    - Recently certified: Ohio teaching certificate obtained August 2024  
    - Classified at Step 14 ($80,000/year), indicating 14 years K-12 teaching experience  
    - Age 35, making the claimed years of experience mathematically improbable given her documented career in opera and higher education  

    **David Coolidge's Classification**  

    - Placed at Step 22 ($88,337/year), indicating 22 years K-12 teaching experience
    - No Ohio teaching certificate on record
    - Age 47, with documented career primarily in freelance arts (25 years) and higher education (10 years)
    - Experience timeline shows mathematical impossibility unless significant role overlap

    **Financial Impact**  

    - Previous single director (Kevin Manley): ~$91,000 with 33+ years experience
    - Current arrangement: Combined salary of ~$180,000 for the Coolidge couple
    - Nearly doubles the administrative costs for what was previously one position

    **Documentation Concerns**  

    - Step placements suggest extensive K-12 teaching experience for both hires
    - Board documents show no evidence of prior K-12 teaching experience or district employment
    - Salary classifications appear to deviate from standard experience-based placement protocols

    **Possible Interpretations:**

    - Potential favoritism/neoptism
    - Circumventing salary protocols outlined in the Findlay Education Association's Collective Bargaining Agreement
    - Compensating her at a higher rate than her actual teaching experience warrants

    The salary classifications raise significant questions about the Findlay City Schools' hiring and compensation practices, especially considering:

    - FCS hired two people to replace one previous director  
    - Combined, the Coolidge couple will earn nearly $180,000  
    - The previous director, Kevin Manley, earned about $91,000 with 33+ years of experience  

<br>  

The documented evidence exposes a disturbing pattern of administrative irregularities within Findlay City Schools that demands immediate scrutiny. 

The Coolidge appointments represent a perfect storm of questionable decisions: mathematical impossibilities in their experience calculations, inexplicable salary step placements, and a stark lack of traditional qualifications. David Coolidge received Step 22 compensation ($88,337) without even holding a teaching license, while Mary Beth Coolidge was placed at Step 14 ($80,000) mere months after obtaining her first teaching certificate - both with zero evidence of K-12 teaching experience to justify these inflated steps. 

Perhaps most egregious is FCS's decision to nearly **double taxpayer costs by splitting one position into two**, resulting in a combined compensation of approximately $180,000 - almost double the ~$91,000 paid to their predecessor who had 33+ years of actual teaching experience. These findings reveal more than just poor judgment; they represent a serious breach of public trust and misuse of taxpayer funds that raises grave concerns about the integrity of FCS's hiring processes and their commitment to responsible financial stewardship of public education resources.

## **But wait, there's more!**
In addition to their already controversial compensation packages, neither David nor Mary Beth Coolidge can play the piano, a critical skill for directing a show choir like Findlay First Edition. This lack of proficiency led the district to hire an external pianist, costing $900 per week for rehearsals.

!!! example inline "Calculating Piano Player Compensation"

    Over the course of the academic year, assuming a standard 36-week school year:

    Weekly Cost: $900  
    Total Additional Cost:  
    $900/week * 36 weeks = $32,400
This expense adds an additional $32,000 to the already increased administrative costs associated with the Coolidges' employment. This decision not only questions the financial prudence of the district but also the rationale behind hiring individuals for roles where they evidently lack key competencies necessary for the job. The choice to essentially outsource a fundamental aspect of their position further inflates the financial burden on Findlay City Schools, demonstrating a significant oversight in the hiring process.

Below are the financial implications of FCS' hiring choices, illustrating the increased burden on Findlay taxpayers:

| Employee | Salary | 
| -- | -- |
| David Coolidge | $88,300
| Mary Beth Coolidge | $80,000
| Unnamed Piano Player | $32,000+|
| **Total Cost** | **$200,300** |
|  |   |
| Kevin Manley's Salary | $91,000 |
| **==Additional Taxpayer Burden To Replace Kevin Manley==** |**==$109,000+ (+120%)==**|


## Red Shirt, Blue Rage: FCS Administrators Wage War on Their Own Alumni

**A recent Homecoming event at Findlay High School has sparked controversy and renewed concerns about the treatment of students and alumni, particularly those associated with the Findlay First Edition (FFE) organization.**
!!! tip inline end "Context"
    *This information is based on information gathered from various sources, including eyewitness accounts and social media discussions.*
A former FFE member, returning to their alma mater for Homecoming, found themselves at the center of an unexpected and unpleasant encounter with FHS principal, Megan Simon. The alumnus, eager to participate in the festivities, was allegedly pressured to change their red FFE shirt due to a perceived violation of the school's "blue and gold" theme. This follows the pattern previously discussed around [employees, students, and parents](../../sections/Key%20Information%20from%20the%20PIR.md#3-derogatory-comments-about-ffe-personnel) who have shown support for FFE in the presence of, or in communication with, FCS administrators. 

This incident has further exposed the deep-seated animosity between Findlay City Schools administration and the FFE community. It demonstrates a persistent pattern of marginalizing and discriminating against FFE members, transforming what should be a celebratory homecoming event into yet another example of administrative overreach and potential harassment.  

The confrontation over a simple red shirt reveals a troubling underlying dynamic: school administrators appear more concerned with enforcing arbitrary dress codes than fostering a welcoming environment for alumni and students. By targeting an FFE alumnus during a homecoming event—a time traditionally meant for reunion and school pride—the administration has once again shown its willingness to weaponize minor rules to suppress what appears to be a continuing institutional bias against FFE. This pattern of behavior raises serious questions about the professionalism and motivations of school leadership, suggesting a systemic approach to marginalizing those associated with FFE rather than promoting inclusivity and school spirit.  

Historically, the Findlay First Edition (FFE) has been a cornerstone of Findlay High School's cultural and artistic identity, with its members consistently demonstrating excellence that enhanced the school's reputation. Through performances, competitions, and community engagement, FFE has not just represented the school, but elevated its standing, serving as a premier example of the talent and dedication inherent in Findlay's student body.  

Today, however, this once-celebrated program finds itself increasingly at odds with an administration that seems intent on exterminating its legacy. The growing divide is not merely a disagreement, but a systematic erosion of a program that has long been a source of pride, achievement, and community recognition. What was once a jewel in Findlay High School's crown now appears to be treated as a threat—a troubling transformation that speaks volumes about the current administrations's approach to institutional culture and student achievement.
