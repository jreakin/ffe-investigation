John,

This is JD Smith writing on Penni’s line--we share this FB post.  I am writing in personal messenger as I do not wish these comments to go public.

As have others, I have been reading your posts concerning the ugly situation with Kevin Manley that occured last year.  I may have been a little closer to the situation than people realize.  About this time last year, I was contacted by FHS administration to work with First Edition through the Christmas season and into January, if needed.  For the sake of the program and feeling that Kevin would soon be returning to his position, I accepted the “return to duty” and was able to keep FFE running as smoothly as possible through the Christmas performances including the spaghetti dinner major performance.  I was ready to continue into January but Kevin was reinstated so my services were no longer needed.

I do feel the upper level administration and school board should be held accountable for their over-reaction to a situation that could have been solved internally quietly and quickly.  That is something that may never happen.  That being said, there are a couple of items in your last post I would like to address.

1) When a teacher, administrator, etc. is hired, the administration has the option to offer a salary schedule higher than the number of years actually served.  They cannot offer a salary lower than the number of years that person has taught.  When I came to Findlay, I had taught for 18 years, I was offered the salary schedule at 10 years.  However, I was granted tenure in my second year and that possibly saved me from being let go shortly thereafter due to cut backs.  

2) Andy Haines salary was never paid by board funds.  It was always paid out of FFE funds that we raised throughout the years.  That was also the case with Kevin and is now the case with the new director and choreographers.  So, putting that amount in the equation really does not compute.  

3) The fact that David Coolidge does not have a teaching certificate should not be an issue either as he is not actually teaching any classes.  He has been hired as a Fine Arts Specialist and he oversees the arts throughout Findlay City Schools.  Normally this position would be a person with a teaching and/or administrator certificate but not a requirement.  

While I will probably have bitter feelings for what happened with Kevin for some time, I am trying to move on and support the program.  I have met with David Coolidge several times and he reaches out to me periodically for advice.  I also have kept in touch with Kevin as we text and/or talk frequently.  I also talk and/or text with Krista Bigger frequently as she is now the head choral director.  And, I would like to add, she is doing a fantastic job.  She is responsible for keeping the overall choral program running at the level it has over the past many years, so she deserves all the support she can get.

David and Mary Beth Coolidge stepped into a situation that was on the brink of collapse and they have worked extremely hard to maintain the level of performance for which FFE has been known.  Their style of performance and choreography may be different that in the past, but possibly it is time for a change.  I want the administration’s and school board’s actions made public.  But I don’t like to see David and Mary Beth Coolidge belittled because they were offered an opportunity to help out in a situation where no one else was willing to step up.

Thank you for your time and effort in this situation.


Best regards
JD Smith

== MY RESPONSE BACK DRAFT ==

Mr. Smith,

Thank you for reaching out and sharing your perspective on the recent article about the Findlay First Edition (FFE) administrative transition.

I acknowledge that the article may not have been written in the most articulate way to fully convey its critical analysis of FCS administration's mishandling of the entire FFE investigation. I am committed to re-editing the analysis to better reflect the core concerns about administrative mismanagement, ensuring the nuances are more precisely communicated.

The goal remains to highlight the administrative missteps and the extraordinary lengths FCS went to in order to resolve a situation entirely of their own making. While the current draft may not perfectly capture that intent, I appreciate the opportunity to refine and improve the piece.

Let me address your specific points:

- Salary Scheduling
    You correctly noted that administrators can adjust salary schedules. The article aimed to illustrate the administrative contortions FCS underwent to resolve their self-created crisis.
- Andy Haines Salary
    Thank you for clarifying the funding source for Andy Haines' salary. The article did not suggest this was from board funds. I recognize now that the reference to Andy Haines' salary was from your reply to a comment on a Facebook post, which has since been removed.
- David Coolidge's Certification
    Regarding David Coolidge's role as Fine Arts Specialist, your point about certification requirements is well-taken. The information was presented to further illustrate the unconventional steps FCS took in their attempt to rebuild the program.

The core narrative remains a critical examination of FCS administration's actions - from their handling of the initial investigation to the subsequent recruitment process that nearly doubled the administrative costs of the FFE program.

I appreciate your insights and continued dedication to the FFE program.
